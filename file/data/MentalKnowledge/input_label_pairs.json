        "completion": "Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life.\r\nMental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital.\r\nIt is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biology.\r\nSimilarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful."

        "completion": "It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background.\r\nAlthough mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children.\r\nAdditionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition.\r\nParents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs)."

What food, drinks, other medicines, and activities should be avoided while taking this medication? 4. What are the side effects and what should be done if they occur? 5. What do I do if a dose is missed? 6. Is there any written information available about this medication? 7. Are there other medications that might be appropriate? 8. If so, why do you prefer the one you have chosen? 9. How do you monitor medications and what symptoms indicate that they should be raised, lowered, or changed? 10. All medications should be taken as directed. Most medications for mental illnesses do not work when taken irregularly, and extra doses can cause severe, sometimes dangerous side effects.

Others may choose to stop taking their medication because of its side effects, without realizing that most side effects can be effectively managed. While it may seem reasonable to stop taking the medication, the problem is that most often, the symptoms will return. If you or your child is taking medication, it is very important that you work together with your doctor before making decisions about any changes in your treatment.\\nAnother problem with stopping medication, particularly for stopping it abruptly, is that you may develop withdrawal symptoms that can be very unpleasant. If you and your doctor feel a trial off your medicine is a good idea, it is necessary to slowly decrease the dosage of medications so that these symptoms don\u2019t occur.\\nIt is important that your doctor and pharmacist work together to make sure your medications are working safely and effectively. You should talk with them about how you are doing and if there are side effects that make you unwilling to continue treatment. They will work with you to develop strategies for minimizing these side effects, or will create a plan for switching to a different treatment that will be a better fit."

We all have to step up during a pandemic because we all have a part to play in reducing the spread of the virus. It's important that you know what must be done and how you should do it. This is important for the health of your neighbours and your own mental health, and taking action can help counter difficult feelings like hopelessness and despair. \r\n One study from people in China found that people who had reliable up-to-date information about the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness and accurate instructions on how they should act (such as instructions around hand-washing and wearing a mask) felt more resilient and felt better able to handle the virus. People who received good, accurate information reported lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. This research is available for free at www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/5/1729. \r\n Of course, it's okay to set limits. Staying informed does not mean that you have to follow the news all day. Check in a few times a day, sticking to trusted sources and media outlets. While social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, social media can also amplify bad advice, vague or untrue stories, and other unhelpful information. Be sure to use good critical thinking skills."

        "prompt": "How can I tell if health information is good or bad?",
        "completion": "Anyone can post anything online. It's up to the readers to think critically about information to decide if it seems helpful, truthful, or safe. Here are key points to keep in mind as you determine which information is worth considering and which information doesn't pass the test. \r\n It's so easy to spread information online, and we can't assume that the source we're reading or watching is the original source. Before you can evaluate anything, you need to know where the claims come from and determine if it's a reliable source. \r\n Reliable sources on the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness include the World Health Organization (WHO), Government of Canada ministries and agencies like Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Government of BC ministries and agencies like the BC Ministry of Health, and the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC). Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health sciences professionals are also important sources of information. \r\n Headlines and titles need to be simple and short, so they can sometimes be misleading on their own. They may also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more. \r\n Websites that belong to governments, government-funded agencies, well-known health providers, universities, or groups of medical professionals are generally the most reliable. Be careful of sites that don't list the author or don't tell you much about themselves. Double-check the author and the credentials of any 'experts' quoted or cited to see if they are actually experts in the topic being discussed. \r\n Can you find other evidence from other sources to support the claims? Does the author list their sources? Are the sources legitimate, like research journals? \r\n Unhelpful sources want you to feel a certain way: scared, angry, distrustful, vulnerable. Phrases like \"Skyrocketing rates of infection\" are sensational and they're meant to make people feel afraid. On the other hand, factual statements like \"We have 50 new cases in BC\" give you important information without playing into your emotions. Helpful news or information sources want you feel informed and empowered. \r\n Who is paying for the site? What products or services are being advertised? What links or other sites do they promote? Are you learning something from a story or experience, or are you simply being directed to buy a product or service? \r\n Social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, especially as we practice physical distancing or self-isolation. Social media can also be an important way to learn from health experts and connect to support services and mutual aid groups in your community. \r\n Like any other source of information, it's important to use good critical thinking skills when you use social media. Studies find that searching for health information on social media generally has very mixed results. You'll see both very poor-quality sources next to good-quality sources, and it's up to you to decide which is which. In addition, social media posts tend to be short and rarely capture everything you need to consider. They are generally useful as a way to start learning or exploring different points of view rather than a place to gather all the information. \r\n Visit www.mediasmarts.ca to learn more about digital and media literacy \r\n Visit www.healthnewsreview.org to learn more about thinking critically around health claims (this resource is no longer updated daily, but all toolkits and lessons are still available) \r\n This page is adapted from the Evaluating Mental Health and Substance Use Information info sheet."

What you can do is make a plan and decide how you'll manage the things you do control, like your ability to stay safe, follow public health measures, stay connected with loved ones, and take care of your mental and physical health. \r\n Events like a pandemic change a lot over time, and that uncertainty can add to fear and stress. The truth is that we don't know what will happen next\u2014but that doesn't mean we're all helpless. You can do a lot. You can: \r\n Map out a daily schedule, including times you can connect with loved ones online or by phone \r\n Plan out daily tasks and goals \r\n Give yourself a schedule to look up current information \r\n Make sure you have 14 days of healthy food and household supplies at home \r\n Keep medications on hand and talk to your doctor for advice if you're at increased risk \r\n Educate yourself on public health measures and figure out how you'll follow those instructions \r\n Figure out how you'll manage increased childcare demands, working for home, or other changes to your usual routine \r\n Determine if you'll need financial supports like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit or BC Temporary Rent Supplement if your job is affected by COVID-19. If you anticipate a need, you can find application instructions and gather any documents or other pieces of information ahead of time \r\n Figure out how you'll manage times when you feel overwhelmed or hopeless, like calming activities, the number for a local support or crisis line, a video chat with a loved one, or a way to connect with your mental health care provider \r\n Look for local support organizations, neighbourhood groups, or mutual aid groups if you need extra help or support or would like to help others in your community \r\n Some planning will be straightforward, but you may also encounter situations or times when it's harder to see a solution or good plan of action. This is a great time to practice problem-solving skills. Problem-solving is a method that helps you break down a complicated situation into manageable pieces, look for realistic and unbiased information, brainstorm possible solutions, and test the solutions that you think might work well. Problem-solving is a helpful skill no matter what else is going on in the world, and it's an empowering, methodical approach when you might otherwise feel overwhelmed or lost. \r\n Check out the following resources for more information about problem-solving: \r\n Wellness Module 4: Problem-Solving: www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-4-problem-solving \r\n Problem-solving worksheet from Anxiety Canada: www.anxietycanada.com/sites/default/files/ProblemSolving.pdf \r\n Effective Problem-Solving in The Antidepressant Skills Workbook: psychhealthandsafety.org/asw"

        "completion": "A lot of people are alone right now, but we don't have to be lonely. We're all in this together. \r\n While you may be physically separated from friends, family members, and other loved ones, it has never been more important to maintain those social connections. Social connections are an opportunity to seek and share support, talk through difficult feelings, share a laugh, keep up-to-date with loved ones, and help each other cope. This pandemic is a lot for one person to deal with on their own. While measures like physical distancing and self-isolation are necessary to slow the spread of the virus, the physical separation can amplify a lot of challenging emotions like loneliness and fear. \r\n Think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you. For example, you might prefer a video chat over a phone call, or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. \r\n Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. \r\n The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. \r\n Everyone feels lonely at times\u2014maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. \r\n Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. \r\n Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. \r\n Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone. To find community services in BC, call or text 211 or visit www.bc211.ca. \r\n If you need extra support, you can talk with a psychologist or counsellor for free: \r\n You can access a free phone call with a Registered Psychologist though the Covid-19 Psychological Support Service from the BC Psychological Association.

        "prompt": "How can I take care of my physical health?",
        "completion": "Taking care of your physical health is also good for your mental health. It's more important than ever to keep yourself healthy. \r\n Try to eat as well as you can. It may be easier to reach for unhealthier comfort foods and snacks while you spend more time at home, but try to keep a balanced approach. When you stock up on groceries, don\u2019t ignore fresh fruit and vegetables\u2014we still have everything we need to prepare food. Now that we're advised to limit the amount of time we spend in public spaces like grocery stores, this is a great time to try out new fruits and vegetables that keep at home for longer periods of time. \r\n If it's safer for you to stay home or you are in self-isolation, reach out for help. Many grocery stores and meal prep services offer safe, no-contact delivery. You can also ask family or friends to bring you groceries, or look for local COVID-19 support groups on social media. It's safest if others leave food and other supplies outside of your door to avoid spreading the virus. \r\n Exercise is an important part of mental health and well-being, stress management, and health sleep. However, it's something that many people give up when they start to feel stressed or overwhelmed. \r\n If it's safe for you to do so, spend time outside. You should still avoid busy areas or groups and stay at least two metres away from others, but there is no reason to avoid walks, runs, or other safe outdoor activities. (Note that some municipalities, BC Parks, and Parks Canada have restricted some outdoor spaces to reduce crowds, so check the status of your local parks or trails and respect closures\u2014they're just keeping everyone safe.) \r\n If you prefer to exercise indoors, you can also find many different exercises classes online. You can try yoga, follow a barre class, work on your cardio, pick up a new dumbbell routine, and keep up with Crossfit WODs from the comfort of your living room. Look for no-equipment exercise routines or classes if you don't already have equipment. \r\n Poor sleep can make even simple problems feel a lot worse than they really are. Poor sleep can affect your mood, your outlook, and your patience. Unfortunately, stress and anxiety can really take a toll on your sleep. If you're having a hard time sleeping, be proactive and practice healthy sleep habits. For more, check out Wellness Module 6: Getting a Good Night's Sleep at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-6-getting-a-good-nights-sleep. \r\n If you have other health problems like a chronic illness, check in with your doctor or health care team to see if you need to take any additional measures or precautions. Remember to plan ahead and do what you can to keep prescription or over-the-counter medications, medical supplies, supplements, or other health needs on hand."

        "completion": "Distraction is a very valid tool to help you cope when everything feels overwhelming or when you feel lonely or isolated. \r\n If you don't have a lot of energy or focus right now, try low-effort distractions like watching TV, browsing Youtube, listening to a podcast or audiobook, playing a game on your phone, reading an easy book or magazine, or working on a simple art project. \r\n If you have more energy and focus, give yourself a to-do list every day: you can clean and take care of projects around your home, work on hobbies, connect with family or friends, read a new book and catch up on your favourite TV shows. You can find interesting opportunities to take online courses from universities all over the world through MOOCs and other online learning platforms, you can learn a new language online or through apps, and you can learn new hobbies and activities. As more people have to practice social distancing or self-isolation, people are finding creative ways to bring the world into their homes: you can tour museums and art galleries, Skype with a scientist, watch animals at zoos and nature preserves, and more. \r\n When normal schedules are disrupted, it's easy to fall into unhelpful habits. Look for ways to keep yourself on track with healthier habits. You could set yourself goals every day or turn activities into a fun competition with friends or family\u2014whoever takes the most language classes wins! \r\n Many communities are using social media platforms like Facebook to organize support and help for neighbours. If you are healthy and it's safe to do so, you can sign up to walk dogs, pick up groceries and household supplies, and help others who can't go out at the moment. This can be a great way to make new connections in your area, and helping others is good for your own mental health. Just be sure to follow good hygiene practices and physical distancing\u2014your own health is important."

        "prompt": "How can I reframe the situation and find more balanced perspectives?",
        "completion": "How you think about something impacts your feelings and your behaviours. \r\n When we feel stressed out, angry, or fearful, it's hard to look at the situation realistically and see all of the options we have. (Remember: we all control our own actions and reactions, no matter what's going on in the world. We can call do something about this pandemic.) \r\n People often overestimate the negative parts\u2014their own feelings, their own abilities to manage a difficult situation, or the situation itself\u2014and underestimate positive parts\u2014their own abilities to care for themselves and loved ones, their support networks, and opportunities. \r\n How does the thought \"We're never going to make it through this!\" make you feel? It likely doesn't feel good\u2014and it isn't even true. \r\n Challenging negative, unhelpful thoughts can improve your mood, validate your ability to get through this, and help you see new options or opportunities to stay well. \r\n Stop and notice thoughts that come up. How do they make you feel? Do your thoughts seem realistic if you look at the situation more objectively? How can you reframe the thought to make it more productive or hopeful? Can you find any positive aspects or think of new ways to approach the situation? \r\n Here are a few example: \r\n \"I'm so mad that my event was cancelled! This sucks!\" \r\n \"I know this is the safer option for everyone. When it's rescheduled, I'll enjoy it more because I won't have to worry about getting sick or spreading the illness.\" \r\n \"I hate spending so much time at home. This is so boring.\" \r\n \"I'm doing my part to keep my neighbours safe. It's worth it because it keeps people healthy.\" \r\n \"I'm having a hard time getting used to my new schedule. This is so frustrating.\" \r\n \"I'll get used to this soon, just like I adapted the last time I had to change my schedule. Now that I'm home more, I'll have more time to finish the projects I haven't touched in months and I'm excited to see the end results. \r\n \"I'm really scared and I don't know what to do. I feel so overwhelmed right now.\" \r\n \"It makes sense that I feel scared\u2014people are getting sick and we don't know when things will go back to normal. But there are a lot of things I can do to keep healthy, and I'm going to do some research so I can do my best. When I focus on the things I can do, everything feels more manageable.\" \r\n \"We're going to be stuck inside forever. I'm already sick of this.\" \r\n \"I understand that it will take some time to manage COVID-19, and I trust that health care professionals and scientists are working as fast as they can. I know this will end eventually and life will go back to normal.\" \r\n The goal is not to ignore the bad or uncomfortable parts of the situation or deny that there's a problem. Instead, this exercise can help you understand the situation more realistically and see the parts that you can control right now."

        "prompt": "How can I challenge thinking traps?",
        "completion": "What you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do. Sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects\u2014this is normal and expected. However, when you interpret situations too negatively, you might feel worse. You're also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term. \r\n These automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps. Everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. You're most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad, angry, anxious, depressed or stressed. You're also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you're not taking good care of yourself, like when you're not eating or sleeping well. \r\n Here are some common thinking traps: \r\n Thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen. People who overgeneralize often use words like \"always\" or \"never.\" \r\n I was really looking forward to that concert, and now it\u2019s cancelled. This always happens to me! I never get to do fun things! \r\n Seeing things as only right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or terrible. People who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure. \r\n I wanted to eat healthier, but I ate too many snacks today. This plan is a total failure! \r\n Saying only negative things about yourself or other people. \r\n I made a mistake. I'm stupid! My boss told me that I made a mistake. My boss is a total jerk! \r\n Predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence. \r\n I've been doing what I can to stay home and reduce the risks, but I just know that I'm going to get sick. \r\n Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive. \r\n I know there's a lot I can do at home, but I'm just so sick of this. Everything is terrible. \r\n Believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation. \r\n I feel scared and overwhelmed right now, so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better. \r\n Telling yourself how you \"should\" or \"must\" act. \r\n I should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying! \r\n Here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. Many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills. You can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca. \r\n Don't try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way. \r\n This doesn't let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. When you try and push upsetting thoughts away, they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind. \r\n Ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens: \r\n What is the situation? What actually happened? Only include facts that everyone would agree on. \r\n What are your thoughts? What are you telling yourself? \r\n What are your emotions? How do you feel? \r\n What are your behaviours? How are you reacting? What are you doing to cope? \r\n Take a look at the thoughts you've listed. Are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns? It's common to fall into more than one thinking trap. Go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation. \r\n The best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts. Use the evidence you've collected to challenge your thinking traps. Here are some ways to do that: \r\n Try to find evidence against the thought. If you make a mistake at work, you might automatically think, \"I can't do anything right! I must be a terrible employee!\" When this thought comes up, you might challenge it by asking, \"Is there any evidence to support this thought? Is there any evidence to disprove this thought?\" You might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently, which doesn't support the idea that you're a bad employee. \r\n Ask yourself, \"Would I judge other people if they did the same thing? Am I being harder on myself than I am on other people?\" This is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self-criticism. \r\n Find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. For example, you might have trouble with one of your kids and think, \"Good parents wouldn't have this kind of problem.\" To challenge this thought, you can ask other parents if they've ever had any problems with their kids. \r\n Test your beliefs in person. For example, if you think that your friends don't care about you, call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call. If you assumed that they will all say no, you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you. \r\n Once you have worked through some challenges, try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps. Let's use the following example: \r\n I feel sad and overwhelmed. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do. \r\n I'm the worst! I should be able to handle this! \r\n Labeling \r\n 'Should' statements \r\n Examine the evidence: I have a lot of challenges right now. I'm worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. I've successfully handled complicated situations in the past, so I know I can do this. \r\n It's okay to feel upset right now\u2014there's a lot going on. I'm going to think about how I got through past situations and see what worked for me. I'm trying to do a lot on my own, so I'm going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together. \r\n Try the Healthy Thinking Worksheet at www.heretohelp.bc.ca \r\n Check out Anxiety Canada's articles Helpful Thinking and Thinking Traps \r\n This page is adapted from Wellness Module 8: Healthy Thinking at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-8-healthy-thinking."

        "prompt": "How can I manage grief?",
        "completion": "While a lot of people think of grief in terms of losing a person or pet, grief can come up whenever you lose something important. This includes: \r\n Losing security, like losing your job or wondering how long you'll be able to pay rent \r\n Losing stability or routine, like finding yourself working from home or navigating childcare closures \r\n Losing your sense of safety, like fearing you or someone you love might end up with COVID-19 \r\n Losing your social relationships, like missing time with family and friends now that everyone must practice physical distancing or self-isolation \r\n Losing hope for the future, like feeling that life will never go back to normal \r\n Losing important goals, like finding your classes, sports competitions, or performances are cancelled for the foreseeable future \r\n Losing important milestone celebrations like graduation ceremonies and weddings \r\n Grief bring up complicated feelings. You might feel sad, angry, frustrated, fearful, or hopeless. You may have a hard time eating or sleeping, or feel very tense. You may feel overwhelmed and tired. You may wonder if life will ever feel normal again. \r\n Everyone grieves in their own way and their own time. Here are some strategies to try as you navigate your own journey. \r\n Acknowledge and express your feelings in a healthy way. Give your feelings a name and find healthy ways to express them, such as by talking with a friend, writing in a journal, or making art. \r\n Give yourself as much time as you need. Grief follows its own schedule. Give yourself permission to use this time to take care of your well-being. Let go of expectations, tasks, or other obligations that can wait. \r\n Seek support. Grief can feel very isolating, even though a lot of people are experiencing some sort of loss right now. Reach out to friends or family and share your feelings. Look for ways to help and support each other. \r\n Take care of yourself. Ignoring health and well-being can make difficult experiences feel worse. Eat as well as you can, try to get enough sleep, spend time outside if it's safe for you to do so, and exercise regularly. Think about self-care activities or strategies that have helped you cope with challenging situations in the past and make time for those activities. \r\n Know that feelings of grief will pass. Grief may feel intense at times, but those feelings will become more manageable over time and will eventually pass. \r\n Connect with a mental health professional if you're having a hard time. If you're having a hard time getting through the day, coping in unhealthy ways, or having a hard time managing difficult thoughts or feelings, it's a good idea to seek help from a professional like a psychologist or counsellor\u2014many now offer online or phone appointments.

Some plans will cover a certain number of private counselling or therapy sessions. In addition, a workplace Employee/Family Assistance Plan may offer some services or may refer you to community services. \r\n Some psychologists, clinical counsellors, or other service providers may offer a sliding scale, which means that their costs are based on your income.

        "completion": "A psychiatrist is a medical doctor with extra training in mental health who can choose to prescribe medications. Some use psychotherapy (\u2018talk therapies\u2019) approaches like cognitive-behavioural therapy to treat mental health problems. Many psychiatrists work at hospitals, clinics, or health centres, and some have a private office. As they are specialist doctors, you will almost always need another doctor\u2019s referral to see a psychiatrist, and fees are covered by MSP. If you have a valid BC Services or CareCard, you do not need to pay to see a psychiatrist. \r\n A registered psychologist focuses on different talk therapy or counselling approaches to treatments, but they don\u2019t prescribe medication. They have graduate degrees in psychology. There are two different ways to access registered psychologists: the public system and the private system. Registered psychologists in the public system work in some hospitals or schools. You may need a doctor\u2019s referral to access the program, and costs are usually covered by MSP. However, most people need to access registered psychologists through the private system. To do this, you can contact the psychologist yourself\u2014you do not need a referral. Costs are not covered by MSP, but they may be covered by employee health plans. A registered psychologist\u2019s fees charged by hour vary, and some offer lower fees to people with lower incomes. \r\n You\u2019ve probably noticed that a lot of the differences come down to how you pay for different services and how these professionals are educated. The practical differences in how they work are not always so clear. When it comes to your treatment and care, the most important part is finding a professional who supports your own goals. Are you really focused on fine-tuning medications? Are you looking for a particular therapy approach? Does the professional\u2019s philosophy of care make sense to you? Do you like the professional you\u2019re talking to and do you feel safe sharing your experiences? Ultimately, your relationship with the professional is what matters. Instead of focusing on designation, look for a professional who meets your needs and your expectations. \r\n Talk to your family doctor and ask for their recommendations \r\n Ask local mental health organizations for help. You can find local branches through the provincial organizations behind HeretoHelp \r\n Ask a community health centre, outpatient psychiatry program, or mental health team for suggestions \r\n For a list of psychiatrists near you, search under \u2018Specialist\u2019 in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia\u2019s Find a Physician Tool but remember that you will first need a referral from a doctor (like your family doctor) \r\n For a list of psychologists near you, search in the British Columbia Psychological Association\u2019s Find a Registered Psychologist tool and you can also learn more about finding a psychologist from the College of Psychologists of British Columbia"

        "prompt": "What is the difference between psychotherapy and counselling?",
        "completion": "Psychotherapy and counselling have a lot in common and usually mean the same thing. Both are used to describe professionals who use talk-based approaches to help someone recover from a mental illness or mental health problem. Many different professionals may provide counselling or psychotherapy, including registered psychologists, registered clinical counsellors, psychiatrists, other therapists and counsellors, family doctors, psychiatric nurses, and faith leaders. \r\n It\u2019s useful to talk to someone about any problem\u2014a lot of people find that simply talking with friends or family can help them feel better. A professional therapist or counsellor can offer more: they have training, experience, and emotional distance (since they don\u2019t know you). They use different theories to listen to you, support you, and approach different problems or patterns. For example, a psychotherapy called cognitive-behavioural therapy is based on the theory that learning skills to change your thinking and actions can positively impact your emotions, well-being, and future thoughts and behaviours. A therapist could help you learn and practice these skills. \r\n There are many psychotherapies with good evidence of being effective for different problems or illnesses. A few examples include cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, solutions-focused brief psychotherapy, narrative therapy, and emotion-focused therapy. \r\n In general, some aspects of therapy and counselling are the same, no matter which approach you choose: the expectations you bring to your counselling sessions, the match between your understanding of the problems and your therapist\u2019s understanding of the problem, and the trust and rapport that you have with your therapist. In fact, one research review found that 50% of the improvement seen in clients who just received active listening and support from a counsellor (called non-directive supportive therapy) was due simply to the relationship between client and therapist.1 Psychotherapy can and does work, but the professional you choose, and their match with your values, is also very important. \r\n When you\u2019re looking for a professional, it\u2019s always a good idea to ask if they are a member of a professional organization (like those listed in the next section)."

        "completion": "CBT (cognitive-behavioural therapy) and DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) are two forms of psychotherapy or \u201ctalk therapy.\u201d In both, you work with a mental health professional to learn more about the challenges you experience and learn skills to help you manage challenges on your own. \r\n Cognitive-behavioural therapy or CBT teaches you how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours influence each other. For example, if you believe that people don\u2019t like you (thought), you might avoid social situations (behaviour) and feel lonely (feeling). However, CBT teaches you how to use these relationships to your advantage: a positive change in one factor (changing a thought or behaviour) can lead to positive changes in all factors. CBT is an approach that has been proven by research to work for many different mental health problems, including depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and substance use problems. \r\n CBT is structured, short-term, goal-oriented and focused on the present. It starts with education around the particular mental illness or challenge and how the illness or challenge affects you. Next, you\u2019ll learn and practice skills and strategies like problem-solving or realistic thinking to help you make changes in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. You\u2019ll learn how you can use your new skills to deal with problems in the future. \r\n Dialectical behaviour therapy or DBT is based on CBT, with greater focus on emotional and social aspects. DBT was developed to help people cope with extreme or unstable emotions and harmful behaviours. DBT is an evidence-based approach to help people regulate emotions. It started as a treatment for borderline personality disorder, and current research shows it may help with many different mental illnesses or concerns, particularly self-harm. \r\n Key differences between CBT and DBT are validation and relationships. DBT teaches you that your experiences are real, and it teaches you how to accept who you are, regardless of challenges or difficult experiences. Relationships are also very important in DBT\u2014including the relationships between you and your DBT practitioner. You may have frequent check-ins to talk about any successes or problems. Treatment may include a mix of one-on-one sessions and group sessions. In addition to CBT skills, you\u2019ll learn skills around managing your emotions, building relationships with others, coping well with problems or distress, acceptance, and mindfulness. \r\n As with many talk therapies, it takes time and effort to enjoy the benefits of CBT and DBT skills. But once people master skills with support from your CBT or DBT therapist, they often find that their new skills and strategies become second nature\u2014they are tools that last a lifetime."

Each class may contain several different medications, which each have slightly different ways of working. Below, you\u2019ll find common classes and examples of common medications. The first name is the generic name and name in brackets is the brand name. \r\n SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Cipralex), and sertraline (Zoloft) \r\n SNRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors: venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) \r\n NDRIs or norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors: bupropion (Wellbutrin and Zyban) \r\n NaSSAs or noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants: mirtazapine (Remeron), which can also be classed as a TeCa or tetracyclic antidepressant \r\n SARIs or serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors: trazodone (Desyrel) \r\n There are other classes of antidepressants (such as MAOIs or triclycics) that are much older and have more side effects or restrictions. They are usually prescribed when newer antidepressants don\u2019t work. Other medications such as lithium, thyroid medication, or antipsychotics may also be prescribed, often in combination with an antidepressant to boost its effect. Antidepressants are not only used to treat depression\u2014they may be prescribed to treat other illnesses like anxiety disorders. \r\n Only medical doctors like family doctors or psychiatrists can prescribe antidepressants. If your doctor recommends that you consider antidepressants, keep in mind that most people have to try a few different options before they find the right medication. It can be a frustrating process, especially when you feel unwell, but it\u2019s important to find something that works for you! Side effects and benefits can vary significantly between different people, and it\u2019s difficult to predict how a medication might work without trying it out first. Everyone responds to them differently. It\u2019s very important to have ongoing discussions with your health care team regarding your medication so you can bring up any problems or concerns\u2014or even ask more about how your particular antidepressant works."

Some reactions are not serious, like a rash. In these cases, you can call the pharmacist or call 811 to reach help after-hours. If you have a serious reaction like difficult breathing, dizziness, or confusion, call 911 right away. \r\n When you start a new medication, your pharmacist will give you a printout with information like side effects, signs of an allergic reaction, how long it might take to work, and other information. It\u2019s good information to keep on hand, but it isn\u2019t always easy to read. When you pick up your medication, you can ask the pharmacist to go over the information with you so you understand what you should look for. \r\n If a particular antidepressant or psychiatric medication just isn\u2019t working for you, there are many different options! Unfortunately, finding the right medication can take some trial and error. Different people can have very different experiences with the same medication, and often you need to try something to see if it works (or doesn\u2019t work) for you. This can be a frustrating process, especially when you want to start feeling better, but it\u2019s important to keep trying and work with your doctor so you understand your options. Many people feel intimidated talking to health professionals, but it\u2019s important to share information so you both understand what\u2019s going on and can make good, informed decisions about your health care. Some people also feel embarrassed talking about symptoms or side effects like changes in sex drive or digestion, but its important information for your doctor (and they know that changes in sex drive or digestion are common concerns). You can find strategies, including a mood journal, to help you work with doctors and other health care providers in our Working With Your Doctor toolkit."

        "completion": "It\u2019s difficult when an adult child, sibling, parent, friend, co-worker, or other important person is struggling or behaving in ways that are causing harm. This can be a tricky situation\u2014you want to help, but most adults are responsible for their own care. \r\n There are two important points to think about. First, diagnosing a health condition, especially when symptom-checking is so easy online, can be dangerous. Diagnosis is still always best left to professionals who can look at the whole picture. Remember, too, that the person you care about may have a very different idea of what\u2019s causing their difficulties and what the negative impacts are on their life. Second, except in rare cases, the person being treated needs to be an active player in their own recovery to continue with their treatment, just as they would for any other health problem. If the vast majority of cases, you cannot do this work entirely for them\u2014and trying to do so may damage your relationship. \r\n Be honest about your concerns, the impacts you are seeing that worry you, listen to their point of view and work together to find a solution that works for everyone, even if it means a compromise. You may want to offer to go with them to an appointment, encourage them to do an online screening self-test, or involve someone else close to them who may be similarly concerned and may have more influence in encouraging them to notice changes and seek help. Because you may be feeling frustrated and helpless, it\u2019s important to get care and support for yourself during this time, especially if you\u2019re very close to the person you\u2019re worried about. \r\n In serious situations, the BC Mental Health Act allows someone to be held for a period of time for psychiatric assessment without their consent if they are at risk of harming themselves or others. While it\u2019s necessary in some situations to get someone the care they need, it can be traumatic for everyone involved.

        "completion": "We naturally want to help a loved one who isn\u2019t feeling well. How we can or should help may seem fairly obvious when a loved one experiences a physical health problem, but many people say they\u2019re not sure how to best help when a loved one experiences a mental illness like depression. Here are some tips: \r\n You don\u2019t have to understand exactly what someone else is experiencing, you just need to recognize that it\u2019s a difficult experience. You can try something like, \u201cI can see that this experience or these symptoms are really painful for you,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling unwell.\u201d If you have experienced depression yourself, you might say, \u201cI know how you feel.\u201d Just remember that everyone experiences illnesses like depression differently, and empathy is about recognizing the impact of the illness, not comparing symptoms. \r\n You don\u2019t have to be an expert, but learning more about depression can help you understand what\u2019s going on (and maybe dispel some of the unhelpful myths around depression). Our Depression info sheet is a great place to start, and we have a list of resources at Q&A: Where can I learn more about depression? \r\n Sometimes talking about problems or concerns can really help\u2014in fact, many people who experience a mood disorder say that they just want to be heard. It\u2019s important to understand that talking about something difficult like experiences of depression can be very hard for your loved one. You cannot force them to talk about it, but you can invite them to, and create safe and quiet spaces to talk. If a loved one opens up to you, listen actively\u2014that is, without distractions like your phone or the TV. Really pay attention to what they have to say. Listen with empathy and without judgement. Even if you don\u2019t understand the problem or see the problem in a different way, your main concern is the distress or difficult feelings your loved one is experiencing. You can find in-depth tips on listening and communicating well in Module Three of the Family Toolkit. Some people are not ready to talk about everything at once, or at all. That\u2019s okay! Respect your loved one\u2019s boundaries and let them tell you what they\u2019re ready to talk about. \r\n Even when you have the best intentions, unsolicited advice can be unhelpful. You likely can\u2019t fix the problem, and you may not know the whole story. If you\u2019d like to share what worked for you in a similar situation, you can ask if the other person would like to talk about strategies that worked for you. \r\n Different people need different things\u2014don\u2019t assume you know what\u2019s best! Some people need emotional help, like someone they can talk with. Other people may have a good relationship with a counsellor or other professional, but they might need practical help, like help around the house or help sticking to their treatment plan. And others may simply want to be included in some social events. By asking what a person needs, you may also be less tempted to give advice. \r\n When people experience an episode of depression, they can have a lot of very negative thoughts and feelings. This can take a real toll on others. It\u2019s a good idea to seek support for yourself\u2014there are support groups just for family members and friends. The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of family support groups around BC for any mental illness. \r\n If your loved one isn\u2019t happy with their treatment or would like to try a different option, you can also help them seek different resources or services. You can find general advice in the Ask Us section of HeretoHelp. To find local services, call the BC Mental Health Support Line at 310-6789 (no area code) or email us. \r\n This is very important! You are not responsible for your loved one\u2019s treatment (unless your loved one is your child under 19)\u2014but you can support them as they work towards recovery. In most cases, your loved one\u2019s treatment and recovery plans are their choice\u2014you are there to offer support and encouragement. \r\n In order for any treatment to work, your loved one needs to be actively involved. Forcing or threatening treatment generally doesn\u2019t work and will only hurt everyone involved. In most cases, anyone 19 years of age and older is free to make their own choices. And their choices may include refusing treatment or choosing a treatment you disagree with. It\u2019s important to be respectful and keep honest communication open between you. You can learn more about dealing with this situation in Ask Us: An adult in my life seems ill and won\u2019t find help. What can I do? \r\n If your loved one says that they have thoughts of ending their life, it\u2019s important to take action. Call 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433) at any time or message online at www.crisiscentrechat.ca between noon and 1am.

How we can or should help may seem fairly obvious when a loved one experiences a physical health problem, but many people say they\u2019re not sure how to best help when a loved one experiences a mental illness like schizophrenia. Here are some tips: \r\n You don\u2019t have to be an expert in schizophrenia, but learning more can help you understand what\u2019s going on. There are a lot of myths about schizophrenia, so it\u2019s a good idea to find some trustworthy resources. Our Schizophrenia info sheet is a great place to start.

It\u2019s important to understand that talking about something difficult like experiences of schizophrenia can be very hard for your loved one\u2014and the symptoms of schizophrenia can also make conversations difficult. If a loved one opens up to you, listen actively\u2014that is, without distractions like your phone or the TV. Really pay attention to what they have to say. Give them time to finish their thoughts, even if it takes a bit longer than usual. Listen with empathy and without judgement. Even if you don\u2019t understand the problem or you see the problem in a different way, your main concern is the distress or difficult feelings your loved one is experiencing. You can find in-depth tips on listening and communicating well in Module Three of the Family Toolkit. Some people are not ready to talk about everything at once, or at all. That\u2019s okay! Respect your loved one\u2019s boundaries and let them tell you when they\u2019re ready to talk. \r\n Symptoms of schizophrenia like hallucinations (sensations that aren\u2019t real, like hearing voices) or delusions (beliefs that can\u2019t be true, like believing that you are being followed by a spy) can take some time to stop even when people are receiving treatment and following their treatment plan. As a group, these very distressing symptoms are called psychosis. Many people have a hard time responding to a loved one\u2019s hallucinations or delusions. It\u2019s best to avoid arguing about these experiences. Remember that delusion are symptoms of schizophrenia\u2014they are not thoughts that you can talk someone out of. Telling someone that their experiences aren\u2019t real or aren\u2019t true doesn\u2019t help when the experiences feel very real to that person! A better approach is to empathize with the feelings that hallucinations or delusions bring up\u2014without confirming or denying the hallucination or delusion. For example, if a loved one is frustrated or upset when they hear voices, it isn\u2019t helpful to say something like, \u201cYou\u2019re okay! It isn\u2019t real. I don\u2019t hear anything.\u201d Instead, you might say, \u201cI can only image how upsetting that voice must be. I can see the voice makes you feel scared.\u201d Know that with good treatment and support, symptoms like hallucinations and delusions become much easier for people to manage and lose importance. \r\n Ask how you can help. When people experience a serious mental illness like schizophrenia, they may want to plan how they can take action if they start to feel unwell again, especially if they have dependent children. These plans, such as advanced directives or Ulysses Agreements, are made when a person feels well and are meant to communicate their wishes to loved ones and their care team. Ask your loved one if they have a plan in place so you know what they need if they need help. If you\u2019d like to learn more about planning for care, see the BC Schizophrenia Society. \r\n If a loved one is experiencing an episode of psychosis or is recovering for an episode of psychosis, they might need extra help. For example, people who are actively experiencing hallucinations or delusions might need a lot of personal space and feel uncomfortable being around a lot of people or even making eye contact. When people are recovering from an episode of psychosis, they may need a quiet space and a lot of rest. Sometimes people can get back into their usual routines fairly quickly, while other times it may take a lot of time (and effort) to get back into routines. Keep in mind that too much help can be a bit counterproductive. It may well be faster and easier for you to take care of your loved one\u2019s tasks or chores yourself, but rebuilding activity and confidence are a big part of recovery. Encourage and support your loved one as they take on daily responsibilities, and let them tell you when they need extra help. \r\n Schizophrenia can be a difficult illness\u2014for everyone. During episodes of psychosis, your loved one may experience frightening sensations that you can\u2019t understand. They may act in ways that you don\u2019t understand. Other symptoms of schizophrenia can make it hard for people to express emotions or feelings, communicate clearly, or seem interested in others. It\u2019s important to know that these are symptoms of an illness. They are no one\u2019s fault, but they can still be hard to cope with. Consider reaching out to a family and friends support group for your own support. The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of groups around BC at www.bcss.org/monthly-meetings-calendar/. \r\n As a family member, it\u2019s important to take care of yourself. Try to maintain your regular schedule and activities, such as your exercise routine and hobbies. Ask another family member or good friend to provide help with caregiving, especially in the early days of your loved one's illness. If you need help balancing time for self-care with caregiving duties, check out the BC Schizophrenia Society\u2019s Family Respite Program. \r\n Try to maintain your friendships or the network of people that you have in your life. These will later become important supports as your loved one recovers. Educate them and update them on your loved one's recovery. People are sometimes afraid to ask questions about schizophrenia and this will put them at ease. \r\n This is very important! You are not responsible for your loved one\u2019s treatment (unless your loved one is your child under 19), but you can support them. Schizophrenia can make it difficult for people to make and go to appointments and follow their treatment plan. With your loved one\u2019s permission, you may choose to help by reminding them of appointments, taking them to appointments, or whatever helps in your situation. If your loved one isn\u2019t happy with their treatment or would like to try a new approach, you can encourage them to talk with their care team, like their doctor or mental health team\u2014it can be dangerous to stop or change a treatment without a doctor\u2019s support. \r\n Treatment can be a difficult area for loved ones. It\u2019s hard to see someone you love in pain. You might be scared of the things your loved one is experiencing. You want to help. But in order for any treatment to work, your loved one needs to be active in their care. Forcing or threatening treatment generally doesn\u2019t work (or if it does, in the case of an emergency, only for a short time) and can often hurt everyone involved. In most cases, anyone 19 years of age and older and not at risk of harm is free to make their own choices. And their choices may include refusing treatment or choosing a treatment that you disagree with. It helps everyone if you can be respectful and keep honest communication open between you. You can learn more about dealing with this situation in Q&A: An adult in my life seems ill and won\u2019t find help. What can I do?. \r\n If you think your loved one is at risk of harming themselves or others and they refuse help, it is possible to have them evaluated by a psychiatrist under the Mental Health Act. This process may involve police and other first responders, and it can be a difficult and stressful process for everyone. But it can also be a necessary step if someone is in danger. You can learn more about the Mental Health Act in the info sheet Families Coping with a Crisis and you can find the Guide to the Mental Health Act at www.health.gov.bc.ca/library/publications/year/2005/MentalHealthGuide.pdf.

        "prompt": "Cannabis is legally allowed to 19+ but there are doctor groups saying it is potentially harmful to age 25. Any use or certain use? What is myth and what is fact? If I am a parent, what should I tell my young adult?",
        "completion": "Using cannabis has the potential for benefits and harms. Young people use cannabis, like other psychoactive drugs, to feel good, to feel better, to do better or to explore. Trying cannabis out of curiosity, as an experiment, or while socializing with friends, is related to moderate use and lower potential for harm. Using cannabis to cope with daily life, deal with unpleasant feelings, or fit in with a social group has higher potential for harm. This is because dealing with these kinds of issues is associated with frequent and heavier use, less thought about potential harms and little consideration of alternatives for coping such as talking with a parent or trusted adult or physical activity with friends. \r\n Evidence suggests that the younger a person is when they start using cannabis and the more often they use, the greater the potential for harms. The legal age to use cannabis in BC is 19. However, our brains do not finish developing until about age 25. Delaying cannabis use until early adulthood may reduce potential harmful effects on the brain. \r\n Some young people, especially those with many factors predisposing them to serious and persistent mental health issues, should probably not use cannabis. Cannabis has been associated with an increased risk for psychosis and schizophrenia in this small group of people. Some people with serious mental health issues have also reported that using cannabis has helped them cope with their illness by helping them feel less anxious or stressed. As in most situations, balancing potential benefits and harms of using cannabis will be key for young people who have serious mental health concerns. \r\n Mixing drugs, such as cannabis and alcohol, can also increase the possibility of experiencing harms. Intoxication may be more intense and long lasting and the young person may not appreciate how impaired they are. We often suggest, \u201cNot too much, not too often, and only in a safe context\u201d as a simple way to gauge your use of any psychoactive substance. \r\n As a parent or caring adult, an open respectful relationship with a young person is one of your best resources and ways to prevent harms from substance use. Letting the youth know they can approach you at any time to talk about cannabis, other substances, or anything else of concern to them, says they matter to you and you are ready to listen and engage in dialogue with them. This is a great place to begin addressing anything that might come the young person\u2019s way in life! \r\n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information. The institute is dedicated to the study of substance use in support of community-wide efforts aimed at providing all people with access to healthier lives, whether using substances or not.

        "completion": "\u2018Mental health\u2019 and \u2018mental illness\u2019 are increasingly being used as if they mean the same thing, but they do not. Everyone has mental health, just like everyone has health. As the World Health Organization famously says, \u201cThere is no health without mental health.\u201d In the course of a lifetime, not all people will experience a mental illness, but everyone will struggle or have a challenge with their mental well-being (i.e., their mental health) just like we all have challenges with our physical well-being from time to time. \r\n When we talk about mental health, we\u2019re talking about our mental well-being: our emotions, our thoughts and feelings, our ability to solve problems and overcome difficulties, our social connections, and our understanding of the world around us. \r\n A mental illness is an illness the affects that way people think, feel, behave, or interact with others. There are many different mental illnesses, and they have different symptoms that impact peoples\u2019 lives in different ways. \r\n Health isn\u2019t like an on/off switch. There are different degrees of health. People move on a continuum ranging from great or good health to so-so health to poor health to illness or disability. For example, some people have good health and have no problems going about their lives. Some people experience serious health problems, and their poor health has a very negative impact on their life. Some people have serious health problems that last for a long time, and others have serious health problems that resolve very quickly. Many people fall somewhere in the middle\u2014they\u2019re generally in good health, though the occasional problem may come up. Mental health is the same way. \r\n Just as someone who feels unwell may not have a serious illness, people may have poor mental health without a mental illness. We all have days where we feel a bit down, or stressed out, or overwhelmed by something that\u2019s happening in our lives. An important part of good mental health is the ability to look at problems or concerns realistically. Good mental health isn\u2019t about feeling happy and confident 100% of time and ignoring any problems. It\u2019s about living and coping well despite problems. \r\n Just as it\u2019s possible to have poor mental health but no mental illness, it\u2019s entirely possible to have good mental health even with a diagnosis of a mental illness. That\u2019s because mental illnesses (like other health problems) are often episodic, meaning there are times (\u2018episodes\u2019) of ill health and times of better or good health. \r\n With the right supports and tools, anyone can live well\u2014however they define well\u2014and find meaning, contribute to their communities, and work towards their goals."

        "completion": "Anxiety is a normal reaction to many different kinds of events and situations in our lives. Anxiety is one of our internal warning systems that alerts us to danger or other threats and prepares our bodies to fight back or get out of a dangerous situation. (Scientists call this the \u2018fight, flight, or freeze\u2019 response.) \r\n A manageable amount of anxiety from time to time can be helpful. For example, it can motivate you to prepare for a test a school or finish a task at work. Even happy events like moving to a new home or celebrating an important milestone can bring up anxiety\u2014all of this is just part of being human. \r\n Anxiety is a problem when it becomes overwhelming or unmanageable and it comes up unexpectedly. Anxiety disorders are mental illnesses that have a big impact your life. People may avoid going about their daily lives in order to avoid anxiety. They may experience a lot of uncomfortable physical sensations and physical health problems. Many people say that they know their anxiety isn\u2019t based in reality, but they feel \u2018trapped\u2019 by their thought and feelings. Anxiety disorders can be treated. It\u2019s important to seek help if you\u2019re concerned about anxiety in your life. \r\n Normal anxiety... \r\n Is related to a specific situation or problem \r\n Lasts only as long as the situation or problem/p> \r\n Is proportional to the situation or problem/p> \r\n Is a realistic response to a realistic problem or situation/p> \r\n When someone experiences an anxiety disorder... \r\n Anxiety may come up unexpectedly, for seemingly no reason \r\n The anxiety response to a situation or problem may be much stronger that they would expect \r\n They may experience a lot of unrealistic anxiety, such as fear of a situation that likely will never happen \r\n Anxiety may last for a long time, even when the situation or problem has been resolved \r\n Anxiety may feel impossible to control or manage \r\n They may avoid situations or things that they believe to trigger anxiety symptoms \r\n Here\u2019s an example of normal anxiety and an anxiety disorder. Many people are a bit nervous about flying, which is a totally normal reaction. Yet, if they have to travel for work, they can can get on a plane without any problems. Someone with an anxiety disorder, on the other hand, may not be able to travel to the airport\u2014even if it puts their job in jeopardy. \r\n *Formerly classified as an anxiety disorder and currently classified as Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders \r\n **Formerly classified as an anxiety disorder and currently classified as Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders"

        "completion": "Stress and anxiety are often used interchangeably, and there is overlap between stress and anxiety. Stress is related to the same \u2018fight, flight, or freeze\u2019 response as anxiety, and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress may be very similar. \r\n The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we\u2019re finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what we\u2019re stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. \r\n Anxiety, on the other hand, isn\u2019t always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself. Stress and anxiety are both part of being human, but both can be problems if they last for a long time or have an impact on our well-being or daily life."

It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It\u2019s much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains.

Many people don\u2019t respond to strong emotions like anger, even when others try to provoke them. On the outside, people with SPD may seem cold or aloof, showing little emotion. \r\n While they have a similar name, schizoid personality disorder isn\u2019t the same as schizophrenia. \r\n Schizoid personality disorder is believed to be relatively uncommon. While some people with SPD may see it as part of who they are, other people may feel a lot of distress, especially around social interactions.

Someone with ASPD may disregard laws or expectations, lack remorse when they hurt others or break the law, make reckless decisions, and believe they are superior to others. People may see someone with ASPD as overly dramatic, impulsive, manipulative, and deceitful. Some people may appear charming, at least on the surface. Like all mental illnesses, antisocial personality disorder is a spectrum. Some people may only occasionally act out, while others may break the law often and spend a lot of time in the criminal justice system. \r\n ASPD is only diagnosed in adults, but people with ASPD start to have problems with conduct or antisocial behaviours at a young age. They may be diagnosed with conduct disorder during childhood. \r\n Treatment for antisocial personality disorder, usually psychotherapy, can help reduce the harms of ASPD and help people build empathy towards others. ASPD is treatable and it may improve as a person approaches middle age. \r\n All of us have hurt someone else or acted without thinking of others' needed.

People with OCPD have very inflexible thinking and expect everything to be ordered, perfect, and done their \"correct\" way. This happens at the expense of other important things in life, including relationships with others. Work can take priority over every other part of life, too, and people with OCPD may seem excessively dedicated, but may be unable to complete tasks due to perfectionism. They may struggle to delegate and may distrust other people\u2019s contributions. People with OCPD may not tolerate uncertainty and may have a very rigid understanding of the world\u2014something is either right or wrong. They may also have a hard time spending money on themselves or others, and they may experience hoarding, the inability to throw away items from their homes. The conflict between the desire for neatness or order and the inability to throw things out may cause a lot of anxiety. \r\n While obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have a similar name, they are not the same illness. People with obsessive-compulsive disorder usually understand that their obsessions and compulsions are illogical and usually experience a lot of distress, even though they may not be able to stop obsessions or compulsions. Compulsions are an attempt to reduce anxiety, not to find pleasure. People with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may view their thoughts as part of who they are, see their thoughts as logical, and may find pleasure or benefit in completing compulsive tasks. They may experience a lot of distress when they can\u2019t achieve control or the perfectionism they want. \r\n Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is one of the most common personality disorders.

Schizophrenia does mean \u201csplit mind,\u201d but the name was meant to describe the \u2018split\u2019 from reality that you experience during an episode of psychosis, as well as changes in thoughts, emotions, and other functions. Dissociative identity disorder, on the other hand, does cause a split or fragmented understanding of a person\u2019s sense of themselves. \r\n Dissociative identity disorder is really more about fragmented identities than many different personalities that develop on their own. Most people see different parts of their being as part of the whole person. For people who experience DID, identity fragments may have very different characteristics, including their own history, identity, and mannerisms. A key part of DID is dissociation\u2014feeling detached to the world around you. People who experience DID may have many unexplainable gaps in their memory, forget information they\u2019re already learned, or have difficulties recalling things they\u2019ve said or done. Unlike portrayals of DID on TV or in movies, DID may not be obvious to others, and it can take a lot of time to come to the diagnosis. \r\n Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that causes hallucinations (sensations that aren\u2019t real) and delusions (beliefs that can\u2019t possibly be true, in addition to other symptoms like jumbled thoughts, jumbled speech, and difficulties expressing emotions.

Major symptoms of psychosis are hallucinations and delusions. Hallucinations are sensations that are not real, such as hearing voices or sounds that aren\u2019t real. Hearing voices is a common hallucination, but hallucinations can be experiences with any sense\u2014hearing, sight, smell, taste, or touch. Delusions are strong beliefs that can\u2019t possibly be true. Common delusions include the belief that someone is following or monitoring you, or the belief that you have extraordinary powers or abilities. Other symptoms of psychosis include difficulties concentrating, completing tasks, or making decisions. Thoughts may feel \u2018jumbled\u2019 or confused. Some people have a hard time following conversations or speaking clearly. Psychosis can even affect the way people move or express their emotions. \r\n Schizophrenia is a mental illness that causes psychosis, but schizophrenia also has other symptoms. And it isn\u2019t the only cause of psychosis. In some cases, other mental illnesses cause psychosis, including depression, bipolar disorder, dementia and borderline personality disorder. Psychosis may come up during times of extreme stress, a major lack of sleep, or trauma. People who are using or withdrawing from certain drugs or medications may experience psychosis. Psychosis may also be caused by a brain injury, neurological problem, or other health problem.

On the other hand, \u201cHe is addicted\u201d might mean the speaker thinks the other person is completely unable to control his own behaviour. When people use the word about psychoactive (mind-altering) substances like alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs, they often assume these drugs are dangerous and have the power to control human behaviour. \r\n The evidence, however, suggests a quite different picture. While substance use can clearly contribute to health and social problems, substances can be beneficial for some people in some situations. Many people celebrate a special occasion with a nice glass of wine, for example. Some people use tobacco as a powerful symbol in cultural and spiritual ceremonies. In fact, substances have been used by humans throughout history for many reasons: to feel good, to feel better, to improve performance, for cultural/spiritual reasons, and to have new experiences. \r\n Substance use is more complicated than just \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d It\u2019s helpful to think of substance use along a continuum, from beneficial use to harmful use. Along the middle of the continuum, substance use may be both beneficial and harmful. You have an enjoyable night out with friends, but feel a little ill the next day. At the far end of the continuum, some people develop dependence\u2014they need to continually use the drug in order to feel normal and will keep using even when that leads to financial difficulties, problems at home or at work, health problems, or legal problems. \r\n In general, substance use is a problem when it causes problems for you or others\u2014and how much use causes problems will be different for different people in different situations. The reason a person uses a substance influences the risk of developing problems. For instance, if a person uses a substance to have fun, only occasional social use may follow. But when a person uses a substance to cope with a long-term problem such as social anxiety, then more long lasting and intense use may follow. Managing our risk involves being aware of why we are using and what impacts our use is having on ourselves and those around us. The wisdom of our ancestors suggests a guiding principle\u2014not too much, not too often, and only in safe contexts."

No one has the same combination of life experiences and influences that you do. So even though you and your friend may choose to drink, how and why you use alcohol may be different. \r\n Those of us who drink, seek benefits from alcohol, not difficulties. But sometimes we start using more, and more often, than makes sense. As a general rule, drinking alcohol becomes a problem when it negatively affects our life or the lives of others. Many people imagine this refers to people who consume alcohol \u201call day every day.\u201d But even drinking too much on a single occasion can lead to a problem, for instance making a poor decision such as driving while impaired. \r\n What\u2019s also important to recognize is the potential for negative consequences related to drinking in various contexts (i.e., places, times and activities) and over time (e.g., coping with chronic problems). You can get personalized feedback related to your pattern of drinking as compared to Canada\u2019s Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines via the Alcohol Reality Check screening app. This short, simple screen can be used by people of all ages. \r\n All alcohol use involves some risk. The reasons people use alcohol can influence their risk of developing problems. For instance, if a person uses alcohol to enhance special celebrations, only occasional social use may follow. But when a person drinks to cope with a long-term problem such as social anxiety, then more long lasting and intense use may follow. \r\n By reflecting on your pattern of drinking you can manage your risk for immediate injury or death, your chances for long-term health consequences such as cancer or heart disease, and your risk of developing habitual patterns of drinking that may lead to these harms. \r\n Whenever you decide to drink alcohol, it is helpful to know what steps you can take to ensure that your drinking behaviour is the most rewarding and least harmful possible. The following are some useful guidelines to consider. \r\n Not too much. Managing how much you drink on a given occasion helps decrease risky behaviours. \r\n Tip: Drink slowly and alternate between non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. \r\n Not too often. Drinking in moderation helps to reduce harms to ourselves and others over time. \r\n Tip: Keep less alcohol at home and set limits on how much you are going to drink each week, avoiding drinking on some days. \r\n Only in safe contexts. Making informed decisions about where you drink helps to minimize alcohol-related harm. \r\n Tip: If going to a bar, stay with a group and choose an establishment that is well lit and near safe transportation options. \r\n For information on treatment options and resources throughout BC, call the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service at 1-800-663-1441.

        "completion": "Cannabis smoke, for example, contains cancer-causing toxins. However, the risk of developing some cancers (e.g., mouth, tongue and lung) is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers, partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. And, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. The negative effects of cannabis on the brain, for example, seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol. \r\n Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms. The danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it. Cannabis is legal in Canada as of October 17, 2018. Adults (over age 19 in BC) are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public. Cannabis is regulated by the Province of British Columbia and will be sold through the Liquor Distribution Branch. Cannabis will be tested for quality. \r\n When drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system, it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking. This helps us manage the risks. However, it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system. It is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold, mildew, or fillers that may be toxic. \r\n The legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. When dealing with complex issues, like cannabis policy, no one has all the answers. But as community members, we all have thoughts, feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. Engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use, as individuals and communities, in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm. \r\n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

        "prompt": "How can I convince my kids not to use drugs?",
        "completion": "You can't. But you can influence their capacity to make good choices in a world where alcohol and other drugs are available. It's about helping your child develop the skills to assess what might be helpful in achieving their goals in life. It's also about nourishing a supportive relationship, so they know where to go with questions or problems. \r\n Opening up a discussion about drugs can help strengthen your relationship with your child. Inviting and allowing open, honest conversation about drugs (or any other subject) makes your child know that what they are thinking, feeling and experiencing matters to you. The goal is to get your child talking and sharing their thoughts and feelings. \r\n When young people are asked thoughtful, open-ended questions exploring what they think, it helps them become interested in their own thoughts and behaviour. This process of self-reflection is part of developing critical thinking skills, a part of good decision-making. Critical thinking skills are actually an essential part of reducing the risks related to using drugs. Once young people have considered something carefully, they are a lot less likely to act out of impulse or in response to influence. \r\n There is no rule about how or where a conversation about alcohol or other drugs should start. Even young children know drugs are a part of our culture. They see people drinking around them and are exposed to drugs on TV and in advertising. This makes it a subject that can be brought up naturally while getting ready for a family celebration where alcohol will be present, or if you are planning to visit a relative who uses tobacco, or while swapping stories at the dinner table about what happened at work and school that day. \r\n Talking with teens and young adults about drugs as they make choices on the path into adulthood helps them to develop personal standards, minimize risks and critically assess popular beliefs about drug use. This can be particularly important as they transition to the legal age for using alcohol or cannabis and move out of the family home. While young adults have more independence and more legal rights, parents can continue to be an important sounding board on which to try out their thoughts and ideas. \r\n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

        "prompt": "What is the legal status (and evidence) of CBD oil?",
        "completion": "Cannabidiol or CBD is a naturally occurring component of cannabis. It is extracted from the cannabis plant and often made into an oil for use. CBD is not psychoactive, and does not produce the \u2018high\u2019 of THC (tetrahyrocannabinol), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. CBD is legal in Canada and has been used in the treatment of various medical conditions. \r\n All cannabinoids, including CBD, produce effects in the body by attaching to certain receptors in the brain or immune system. The human body also produces its own cannabinoids. It seems that CBD does not attach directly to receptors. Instead, it directs the body to use more of its own cannabinoids to produce the therapeutic effects associated with CBD. \r\n Research suggests that CBD may provide relief for chronic pain. Sativex is a proprietary medication that combines THC and CBD and may be prescribed for the relief of pain associated with multiple sclerosis. There is also some evidence suggesting that CBD may be a promising support for people with opioid use disorders. The researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders including anxiety, mood-related symptoms, pain, and insomnia. \r\n After researching the safety and effectiveness of CBD oil for treating epilepsy, in 2018, the United States FDA approved CBD (Epidiolex) as a therapy for two rare conditions characterized by epileptic seizures. Other evidence suggests that CBD may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, though further research is needed before introducing CBD into medical practice. \r\n There is some initial evidence that CBD may help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease keep the ability to recognize the faces of people that they know, and thus slow progression of the illness. Again, more research is needed in this area. \r\n Because of the way cannabis and its products are metabolized, scientists believe there is a potential for interaction with other drugs, although nothing significant has yet been recorded. CBD has been found to be generally safe. Reports from patients indicate that negative drug interactions are not common. As with any other treatment, it is important to monitor your use of CBD and seek assistance if you experience any problems or have questions or concerns about its use. \r\n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

        "prompt": "What is the evidence on vaping?",
        "completion": "\"Vaping\" is the term for using a device where liquids, often flavoured, are turned into vapour (hence, vaping) and inhaled. A vaping device consists of a mouthpiece, tank or reservoir to hold the liquid, a heating element and a battery to power the element. The liquid is heated to become a mist, inhaled through the mouth into the lungs where the nicotine or cannabis enters the bloodstream. Any residual vapour is exhaled. Vaping devices come in several types, shapes, and sizes, referred to as e-cigarettes, vape pens, vapes, mods, tanks, or e-hookahs. Vaping liquid (e-liquid, e-juice) consists of a solvent, usually propylene glycol or glycerol, flavour, and nicotine or cannabis, though it may not contain anything. In British Columbia you must be 19 years old to buy vaping products. \r\n The number of young people who smoke cigarettes has declined over the past few years, while vaping has increased. E-cigarettes were developed as an alternative to smoking. The first devices were available in 2003 and looked much like a traditional cigarette. Nicotine vapour contains significantly fewer toxins and other particles than smoke from cigarettes. Vaping is a less harmful alternative to cigarettes and evidence suggests, it may help some people quit smoking. Evidence suggests vaping is likely not a gateway to smoking tobacco. \r\n Though less harmful than smoking cigarettes, vaping still carries potential harms. There is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapour. (A carcinogen is a substance that has the potential to cause cancer). Some evidence suggests that young people may be unaware the vaping liquid often contains nicotine. E-cigarettes are not controlled and the nicotine content of vaping liquids varies significantly among brands. Other chemicals, flavourings, and heavy metals present in vaping liquids, have not as yet been well studied. Long-term health risks from vaping are thus undetermined. More research is needed in these areas. \r\n Marketing strategies for vaping products, often on social media, are designed to appeal to young people. The range of flavours available, especially those that are fruity and sweet, and the look and feel of vaping devices attract youth. Young people can see vaping as fun and a way to socialize with friends and 'smoke' in a less harmful way. \r\n Making the time and space for discussion and exploring the issues around vaping is one important way we can support young people and indeed, each other, in making good decisions about if, when, or how much to vape. We offer, \"not too much, not too often, and in a safe context\" as one way to think about using any substance. What this means to you may be a place for talking to start! \r\n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

I do not think that means that suicide is not bad for the person dying, however. Especially since being in a state of \"wanting to die\" is as justified as being in a state of \"wanting to live.\" In my experience of both states, neither is very logical or rational at all. Its just a blind belief you awkwardly justify either way. I think suicide is bad for the person dying because its getting shoved into something you cannot think your way out of, its like your instincts swap. I think its kind of like, if you can see past an instinct for living, why not the other way around? Why not try and live out of spite, or a sunk cost fallacy? Its as justified as dying, but at least if you live you get to see what happens next. That is just how I think of it though"

I did the math yesterday and my brain finally processed just how much he was not getting his daily caloric & nutrition needs. (not divulging more information). I knew he did not eat a lot already and have talked to him about it in the past, but it all just kind of clicked. I think his stomach hurts when he eats more because of an ED (I am not a medical professional). He also gets really bad migraines, so I do not know how I did not piece all this together sooner. I was talking to him about it and he is open to trying to meet his daily food requirements in nutrients and calories. The only thing now is I do not know how to go about it. I know he can get severe stomach aches (my guess is from under eating) and I worry if we just start trying to meet healthy amounts that it will trigger sever cramps and aches. Should we just try and power through if so? Or should be build up? I am also worried he struggle to maintain the healthier- necessary to live- lifestyle. I also do not know how this all would interact with trying to be more active in the new year considering he works in IT. (This is simply about muscle use, because he is not active throughout the day) I just want a long, happy life together and I want his body to be well nourished.

It is good that you do \"feast\" when you can because getting enough food is so important for your overall functioning, and that is the part that makes us ill. We either refuse ourselves the food that we so desperately need, or we eat the food, and then experience intense feelings of shame and self-hatred. I would say just self-monitor and notice if you are starting to get negative feelings towards yourself for eating more when you are able to afford more food. For a lot of us, our ED's are very sneaky, and an ED can be triggered just by being in a chronic calorie deficit because our brains can be triggered to try and hoard and restrict food and move more as a survival instinct."

        "completion": "I Have been recovering from an ed for almost a year now and i struggled with things like this too. While its certainly hard to break a cycle once its started, especially with things like OCD (or ADHD in my case) it helps so much to just not think about it. Try sitting down with a meal and ignore the fact that you are eating at all. Put all your thought into the news, a show, or talk to a friend while eating. Try to remember that food is fuel. Without fuel, you start enjoying your life less and less. When you do not think about food 24/7, your brain has so much more space to think about everything amazing in life. As for struggling with body image, it took me forever to get used to gaining weight. But at a point, your body resets itself. If you are fueling yourself properly, you body should maintain a healthy weight on its own. You should not keep gaining weight until you could be on 1000 pound sisters lol. I found that looking at yourself in a mirror and only thinking good things about yourself helped me. I think it was important in my recovery to remeber how much time i am wasting worrying about a body i should be grateful to have. I Do Not Know if this was helpful at all, but i wish you luck on your recovery. It may seem like forever, but taking it slow is how you win."

I asked for help much earlier this time due to a fear of organ failure again. I am back to being plus size. My experience has been that no provider that actually treats and is knowledgeable on EDs has ever treated me poorly or suggested that I do not have anorexia. I was welcomed the same as straight sized people and those under weight. Our treatment paths were the same regardless of our sizes. As a friend you can only do so much, your friend has to want help. Please continue to be their support. Research ED treatment in your area. Look up atypical anorexia and share your knowledge with them. Do not ever sweep the anorexia under the rug and pretend it is not there. You may eventually tire of saying or attempting them to eat, your relationship may suffer...just keep being there, letting them know they and their health are important to you. Eating disorders are a complex mental illness that also is rooted in biology, culture, etc. It is difficult to unpack it all. I strongly recommend having professional help. It saved my life."

So really quickly over the past year or so, give or take, sometimes I have eaten a lot of food and then felt uncomfortably full, so to make myself feel better, not like to feel better about myself for eating to much, but to feel not stuffed I have made myself throw up. One time I ate too much cheese on bread and after, I made myself throw up because I felt too full. A little differently at my brother's wedding I drank too much and felt woozy and a little full so I went to the bathroom and made myself throw up. Today I did not eat all day, except for potato chips, and then at like 11 PM or so I had two veggie burgers and two impossible burgers with bread and mayo, I was feeling pretty full when I was almost done eating, but I pushed myself and finished the food. I went up to my room and felt kind of uncomfortable so I went to my basement and started making myself throw up. I had tears coming out of my eyes, from throwing up, not crying. This time was kind of different from the rest because I made myself \"finish the job\", meaning I did not stop until I felt like I had thrown up everything. When I was done I went to the sink and spit out and there was blood in my spit and my throat hurts when I swallow. Is this bulimia or just something that can become bulimia if not addressed.",

In my case I was aware that what I was doing was considered \u201cdisordered\u201d, but I thought because I was aware of that and was \u201cin control\u201d of it, that I did not have an eating disorder. It is amazing the amount of denial that can go on. I was actually sitting across from my therapist, who was an ED specialist, when it occurred to me that I actually might be Bulimic. I would been purging, bingeing, starving for 4 years at that point, and had asked for a therapist who understood EDs, because I related to the perfectionism that people with them had, but I did not truly get that I, personally, had an eating disorder until I would been seeing her for probably 6 months.

Although it is easier said than done, I would hate for her relationship with food to worsen. As i said, i have battled with my relationship with food for a long time. I Have developed lifelong heart issues, my menstrual cycle stopped, i have been hospitalized multiple times, i have stomach & digestive issues, my metabolism will take years to fix, and so many other things\u2014 that is the unfortunate and ugly truth of anorexia. Anorexia is serious and it is good to get help before her physical AND mental health quickly starts to decline, because it surely will (if it has not already) if her bad eating habits continue. As long as you make her feel loved and supported, you are doing enough. I wish you both the best and i hope your partner can recover safely. :)"

        "completion": "I overcame my depression without therapy, and I went through therapy, rehab, and psych wards. Went through a lot of things that were supposes to help me but only made it worse. Depression since I was a teen, and I resolved it by myself through catharsis a few years ago. For sure this is not for everyone. There is no single straight answer. But everything you described felt very reminiscent of what I experienced. I grew up with undiagnosed autism and adhd. I failed school, blamed myself. I think I am lazy because I struggled to meet deadlines and stay focused. It always felt like something was wrong with me. I did not think I had any fear of rejection until I was rejected by a community that I thought accepted me. They cut all ties with me when I had just gone back from the darkest time of my life. I started arguments in my head. Was I really wrong? Am I bad? But a voice inside me just spoke me. The voice that knew the truth and understood that I did my best. The voice comforted me, saying, \u201cI understand you.\u201d I know it sounds bizarre and delusional but I do not think it was. It was a literal voice in my thoughts I heard, but it was mine. And I realized that all this time, the only opinion that should matter is my own. That I knew myself the most and do not need to prove myself. That I should be kind to myself. I should stand by myself and support myself. You have heard of having to love yourself. I do not know how else to explain on how to do that except to try to be your own friend. It does not mean I do not need others in my life anymore. But the right people will naturally come in your life when you are in a better place mentally. I always used to think that I need someone to save me, to help me. But I came to accept that that person does not exist. It is not losing hope or being cynical. It is\u2026. Like accepting you cannot run away from yourself. You have to learn to extend your hand to yourself, and take it. Again this is just my belief based on my exp. Good luck with what you have on your plate"

Towards the end of my treatment (was there for 3 months) they eventually let me out of bed for rehabilitation exercises but nothing that was really calorie burning. I doubt they would let you exercise as it would probably be a trigger for others and they tend to really overthink everything that you do when you have an eating disorder.

She is a wonderful young person and the light of my life. For the last few years, she has been struggling openly with anxiety and depression. I have taken her to a few psychiatrists and she also sees a talk therapist regularly. She is been so far on only a few different SSRIs and is now on Zoloft, which seems to be working just a little bit better for her than other meds. Over the past year, her mental health has gotten even worse though and she is been quite vocal to me about her feelings of helplessness and wanting to get better. I am trying to do everything I can to figure out exactly how to help. She has a lot of signs that she believes may be autism. We do have lots of autistic people in our family, so this is not a wild idea. She did not have any of the typical early childhood symptoms though, but due to her own social media research, she thinks she may be autistic because if her feelings of burnout, need to stim for self soothing, dislike of certain textures and sounds, etc. I am open to this possibility but want to make sure we investigate all possibilities. What my concern is, is that she may actually be showing signs of early schizophrenia. If this is the case, I would like to get the right interventions in place before a major episode of psychosis potentially causes big problems for her. Here is why I am questioning whether this could be the case: 1) she says she sometimes hallucinates flies, as in she sees flies that she later realizes are not real. 2) Her mental health symptoms get worse at night. 3) She has lots of intrusive thoughts that really upset her, such as thoughts of grisly violent things, harm happening to people she cares about, imagining her beloved cat is dead, etc. I know she must have lots of disturbing intrusive thoughts about herself doing bad things, because she cries a lot that she is a bad person. 4) she admitted she did a very large amount of psilocybin mushrooms at one time (first time user and did not know she was using too much) last year and said she had lots of hallucinations when she did it, and that she still gets vivid flashbacks of this. 5) she has paranoid thoughts and fears sometimes about things like there being people in the walls or attic. 6) she gets really upset about things sometimes if she makes a mistake like spilling a bowl of food and then she hits herself and talks about self harm. I am not sure if these might be early signs of schizophrenia or not. I have tried to do research and read some people say that hallucinations of insects were their first signs. I do not know how long it takes to go from that to big breaks in reality though. Can anyone share your experiences with me? I just want to help her but am not sure how. I am NOT expecting or asking for anyone to attempt to offer a diagnosis, obviously. What I am interested in is hearing from people with schizophrenia as to what your first symptoms were and how long did it take from those to first episode of psychosis? Also, if anyone with a diagnosis other than schizophrenia has had these same types of symptoms, what is your diagnosis? I am still working on finding the right professionals to take these things seriously and I would like to do my own research to take to the professionals as well and just to be more enlightened as to what might be going on. Thank you!",

        "completion": "I have schizophrenia, mine showed itself @ age 30 (and same goes for my cousin). It does sound somewhat in the same vein (not all of it though). Either way it does sound like psychosis may be in the beginning stages, at least symptoms of it (delusions like people living in the walls, hallucinating) keep in mind psychosis can stir from other illnesses/triggers aside from schizophrenia. You can even have these kinds of symptoms after a few days of missing sleep, depression, bipolar, personality disorders like Borderline, and so on."

I was always very open with my mom but when I was sexually assaulted I was so ashamed I could not tell anyone. I behaved in many of the same ways as your daughter. I had some mild hallucinations and things got really bad at night. I could not sleep because as I would fall asleep I would hear things and see things that were not there and I would see images of awful things. This has happened to me one other time in my life and that was after I watched someone die in my arms without being able to help them. So, I guess I wonder if this is a trauma response to something?"

        "completion": "This is fairly complex and you need to consult a professional. But I will give some insights since I have some clinical experience in this area. That does not sounds like classic onset schizophrenia. Sounds more substance induced to me. Auditory hallucinations are by far the most common type of hallucination in schizophrenia. I would NOT trust self reports on the internet. Insects as sign of psychosis is not pattern in that population. The argument for autism here is also very flimsy. Self diagnosing with autism is very trendy right now on social media. If she developed normally as a young child, that is an extremely unlikely diagnosis. Using self harm to manage difficult emotions is not as rare as you think and usually is related to depressed and emotional problems. That sounds like classic teen issues. I would steer you away from trying to read the tea leaves on the more exotic and severe disorders and suggest getting an experienced therapist and/or considering family session. The vast majority of teen psych issues are emotional problems, issues with family dynamics, peer dynamics, trauma, and self image."

        "completion": "Marine corps vet with ptsd and major depressive disorder, let me just start by saying that the only medication that has actually helped alleviate symptoms of severe anxiety for me personally has been beta blockers. If she is experiencing a kind of constant tightness in her chest often associated with anxiety then it could possibly be hypertension due to stress. Propranolol is the beta blocker that has worked for me although I am sure there are others that work great as well. Unfortunately the psychological link between anti depressants or SSRI\u2019s actually helping with depression is weak at best. The science behind most antidepressants comes from data mostly dating back to the 1960s when it was believed that depression was caused by a lack of, or excessive amount of endorphins, dopamine, and or serotonin. (This is also the time period where doctors legitimately labotomized mental patients as a form of treatment, so keep that in mind) New studies have concluded that there really is not enough of an understanding of the human brain to be sure that this is the case and with new studies showing it is actually more likely that it is not any sort of chemical deficiency in those with severe depression. That being said everyone should consult a licensed psychiatrist and see what they recommend. My personal opinion is that just about every antidepressant or SSRI has about 6 or more pages of side effects many of which because more harm than good. I am by no means anti medicine or anything like that. However having experienced enough of them myself, each one of them took the color out of life, to the point where I would feel almost nothing on an emotional level, to the point where I straight up could not recognize my own emotions anymore. Not to mention almost every one of them caused pretty severe sexual dysfunction, lack of libido, erectile dysfunction, ect\u2026 teenagers are already at their most hormonal point of their lives and these kind of issues at that age can be devastating to their self esteem and or self image ultimately exacerbating depressive episodes. As for whether or not she could be exhibiting signs of schizophrenia I believe the chances of that to be quite low. My mother has a form of schizophrenia and fortunately my sister and I have been lucky enough that neither of us got it. In most documented cases that I am aware of, schizophrenia is a genetic disorder, if you have family members who have it then it is possible she may have it however unlike most mental illnesses it exhibits a pattern of switching genders. (What I mean by that is that if a mother has schizophrenia she is more likely to pass it along to her son than her daughter. If a father has it he is more likely to pass it to his daughter rather than his son. (I would confirm this with a psychiatrist as I cannot remember how valid that information is or where I first read about it). I also believe that symptoms usually do not start to show until your early to mid twenties but that may not always be the case. I definitely recommend verifying my Information on your own time and or consulting a medical professional. Currently the best thing I would recommend is therapy, which I understand can be expensive and unreasonable for some, if that is the case then I would suggest digging around online to see what state or federal resources could make it more affordable. To elaborate on what I mean by therapy, there are several programs ranging from 8-10 weeks, usually one session per week. Cognitive behavioral therapy which has a lot of research to back it up is a great program. Usually marketed for treating ptsd however the underlying concept involves talking through events that are the root because of anxiety or depression or a traumatic event, these three things can alter what psychologists refer to as our \u201cjust world views\u201d our just world views are things that we believe to be true in society. These change a lot during adolescence and even more in early adulthood but those changes are not always good, take for example victims of sexual abuse in any form, before sexual abuse an individual may believe \u201cthey are safe to go about their business and can trust those around them.\u201d After sexual assault their views would alter to something along the lines of \u201cpeople will hurt me if I give them a chance, I cannot trust anyone, i am ashamed of what I have become\u201d these altered views are often the root because of anxiety especially and may contribute largely to depressive episodes. Last but not least, psilocybin the hallucinogenic component in mushrooms has been studied over the last couple of years with clinical trials showing that both LSD and or \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d are incredibly effective at short term treatment for anxiety disorders, OCD, PTSD, addiction to a substance, ect. However the visual hallucinations your daughter is experiencing sounds more like HPPD or hallucinogenic persisting perception disorder, scientists have identified two types of HPPD Type 1 (which sounds like what your daughter may be experiencing) type 1 being brief random flashbacks, things like seeing light distortion or other minor hallucinations that usually have little effect on a person\u2019s capability to function think or otherwise live a normal life. Then we have type 2 which is long term pervasive and more intense often making regular function hard. HPPD is a very rare condition that scientists have yet to fully understand so my knowledge is limited to what is here but I encourage you to seek out more information from accredited sources. I wish you the best of luck in helping your daughter on her road to recovery if you have any further questions for me feel free to message me directly and I will be more than happy to try and point you in the right direction."

        "completion": "I used to be a mental health nurse and I just wanted to share some of my insights here: 1) Definitely sounds like your daughter is having some psychotic experiences but do not jump to diagnoses. Focus on emotions and patterns of behaviour. Psychosis is a normal part of the human experience, especially when we are sleep deprived and/or put under extreme stress. 2) You have mentioned a lot about the medical, but you also need to look at triggers, coping strategies, and rountines of self care. Medication is only apart of the solution. If she is tried a few of SSRIs I would talking to her psychiatrist about an SNRI such as venlaflaxine or mirtazapine. Her age might be a factor there. Mirtazapine might help if she is struggling more at night. 3) Encourage her to set her own small achievable goals. Like going out for a walk, making some dinner, having a shower or getting out of bed. Sometimes when you are supporting someone we are very quick to say \"no your not failing\" \"no you having nothing to worry about\". Alot of the time people need to hear that you understand the pain like \"yes this is tough\" \"let us tackle this problem in smaller chunks\" or \"it is not failing its just a setback\". But she needs to be in a place where its achievable."

Getting 5-30 minutes of bright sunlight/daylight first thing in the morning has many benefits for body and mind. I however struggle to get out of bed, so I have a light therapy lamp at my bedside that I turn on as soon as I wake up and then differentiate between staring at it and at my phone. It makes a HUGE difference for my energy and mood. Going outside and looking at the sky within the first hour of waking should have the same effect. 5 minutes on a bright, sunny morning \u2014 15 minutes on a slightly cloudy morning \u2014 30 minutes on a overcast or rainy morning. Exercise/movement. I struggle to actually work out, but any movement helps. Going for a walk, doing gardening, taking the stairs etc. I would rather incorporate more movement into my everyday than try (and fail) at getting a work out regime, as it is much easier for me to actually get done. Prioritizing my sleep. I struggle with hardcore insomnia, so this is a bit of a complex regime, but better sleep makes a huge difference. Proper(ish) food. Not that everything has to be perfectly healthy, but getting some good nutrients, fibers, healthy fats and proteins and avoiding too much sugar definately helps. If not directly, then indirectly by giving me more energy/less crashes and better sleep. I also supplement high quality fish oil, magnesium, vitamin C and vitamin B complex as I have noticed it having an effect on energy/mood and physical pains. I get regular bloodwork done due to antidepressants and will advise anyone to do the same and discuss with your healthcare provider before starting supplements."

        "completion": "Yes I have experienced exactly that and have even been banned from the lgbtq+ community for talking about my rape story publicly and one of the mods found it offensive because \"men cannot be raped\". I do not understand the world view of a person like that or what kind of mental gymnastics you must undergo to find yourself in that level of self-brainwashing. I also was banned on the LGBT community for asking a simple question that was not offensive but I will not get into any of that because of how unrelated it is. However still I feel the need to mention it because of just how volatile that community can be when it all seems like they just want to stroke their offended ego instead of having actual conversations that are productive. Honestly the only way to deal with it is to advocate for yourself even when you experience backlash and to learn how to grow a thicker skin as harsh as that sounds but that is what I have found I must do in order to change anything. I know that sounds harsh to say but it is the lesson I learned because people on the internet are not going to be nice to you and if you want to survive it you must learn how to not let it get so far under your skin. It unfortunately will always affect you or at least it still does for me, maybe one day that will change. I really do not know if it will change but all I know is staying quiet is the worst thing that you can do because it only serves to validate what they say if men like us stay quiet about these things."

Ask them about the nature of the services and who provides them. If you feel comfortable with them, do that. You can find another adult you trust as well, like a family member, friends\u2019 parent, or teacher. Do you have health insurance? If you do, you can call the customer service number on the back of the card and ask them what providers you can access near you. Please know that they send service summaries every few months by mail, so your parents might find out about it like that. If you do not have health insurance, call places like Planned Parenthood and ask about resources. Again, you absolutely should talk to your parents if the only thing holding you back is feeling embarrassment or feeling scared of disappointing them.

Try to graze on small bites throughout the day if a big meal is too much for you, just to get something in you are stomach. Aim for something with decent protein or fiber for energy, do not snack on just lettuce or something. Nuts, nut spreads and crackers, cheese, boiled eggs, veggies and hummus, all great options. And make sure you are replenishing electrolytes and drinking lots of water, the nausea could be from dehydration too.

        "completion": "As a psychologist, I would recommend several strategies to help motivate yourself to clean your room: Break the task down into smaller, manageable steps. Instead of focusing on cleaning the entire room, set a goal to clean just one area or to declutter for a set period of time. This can help to make the task feel less overwhelming. Use positive self-talk. Remind yourself of the benefits of a clean space, such as improved mood and reduced stress. Create a rewards system. Treat yourself to something you enjoy after completing the task of cleaning your room. Set a deadline. Give yourself a specific day and time to have the task completed. Practice mindfulness. Try to focus on the present moment while cleaning, take deep breaths and try to be present and aware of your surroundings. Seek professional help. If you are dealing with depression and finding it hard to engage in daily activities, it is important to seek professional help. A therapist can help you to understand your depression, learn coping strategies and regain a sense of control over your life. It is important to remember that depression is an illness that can affect motivation and energy levels, and it is important to be kind and compassionate with yourself and not to overburden yourself."

        "completion": "As someone who was transported recently from an ED to a larger hospital with a inpatient ward, I can tell you that showing genuine care and compassion will go a long way. If they are in crisis but lucid, let them control the conversation and communicate actions before you do them. \"So I need to monitor your vitals while we are moving, standard policy for anyone on the stretcher. Which arm would you prefer the cuff on?\" Giving them agency when you can helps ground them in the here and now and that they still have some control. Sure it is \"right or left\" but they are going to be in an environment where their choices are limited. If they feel like talking, just do good active listening and let them talk about whatever they want. A lot of people get to that point because they are feeling trapped, alone, afraid, hurt, or angry. Many do not feel like people are listening to what they communicate. My transport was ridiculously early in the morning so I dozed. And was grateful my EMT made sure I was warm and kept the lights low. Finally, do your best to keep PD away from the patient. If they do not have a damn good reason to be interacting they need to step back. The presence alone of cops makes people with mental health issues at risk of being killed. Always keep your patient's best interests paramount. Airway is clear, not strapped prone to a stretcher. Nor are cops able to order you to administer shit. If they say shoot the guy up with ketamine, that is a no. Do whatever you need to do to stabilize and transport away as fast as possible. Cops can fill out their paperwork later. They are not your friend when your patient is in a mental crisis. They are like a Home Depot bucket overflowing with gasoline near a camp fire. Just does not end well. Especially with LGBTQ+ and BIPOC, but any one in crisis is at risk of state violence. As an EMT, you may be the only one capable of getting them separated so they can be stabilized and receive help. Sorry for the rant, but it is a big concern for those suffering from mental health issues. Myself and others I know all have the same apprehension and fear."

There is nothing specific you can say that will apply to anyone - although it would be nice if there were a way to make it so... Do not share about your life unless asked, but if they do, feel free to be vulnerable with them and make it a moment of genuine human connection. Also, he sat with me in the hospital room for about 15 minutes before he had to leave and go on the next call and that was really kind that he wanted to make sure I was comfortable If they called in for themselves it would be cool if you told them that you are proud of them for reaching out for help. Tell them that they are brave and strong, and the people in the hospital really care about them and want the best for them.

Even if they did; there are plenty of happy people out there with weird eyes :) I have even dated a couple =P My self-esteem was so low when I was younger that I did not have my first boyfriend until 27. I never even held a guy's hand until then. I assumed no one wanted me (I am pretty fat) and when I went out with my friends I had a complete energetic block towards men. My friends always got the attention and I was the funny fat friend. I thought that was actual truth and I accepted it. After what I call a \"nervous breakdown\" at 26, I decided to just surrender to life - take risks and be vulnerable because I was rock-bottom-miserable anyway. The negative self talk combined with the stress of the world really caused me to breakdown. After I left my depression/anxiety room, I decided to change my mind about not feeling desirable (among other changes) and I swear it was like a magnet turned on inside of me. I was being asked to dance when I went out and I was able to talk to men as if I did not care if they wanted me or not. I know it is not the healthiest path to self-esteem but all of the attention/validation I was getting helped me socialize with men and I landed my first boyfriend at 27. Fast forward to today - I am 40 and divorced but in the best relationship of my life. I have a ton of dating experience under my belt and complete confidence with men. This confidence actually spread to all other aspects of my life like wildfire in my 20s and even propelled my career. It transformed over the years into a more healthy version, not dependent on external validation, because I was living life and succeeding in the ways that I wanted. TL;DR: Yes, it is definitely possible. We have absorbed SO MUCH negative programming about EVERYTHING that it is no wonder we bully ourselves in our heads so much and stay stagnant in life. You have to realize that everyone has to take risks and be vulnerable to rejection to get what you want out of life. Nothing changes if nothing changes. You absolutely have to turn off that monologue in your head until it starts saying positive things. It takes practice, but most importantly, you have to decide to love yourself so that you can be patient with the process."

But basically the past few days have been this. A lot of the time I am not even physically hungry but my mind is screaming for more food. I know that this is a part of the process and logically I understand that it is probably good for me as well because I am underweight as all hell, but boy does it feel bad. And boy does it look bad to others. I have told some of my family members about my ED and about me starting recovery and they seemed to acknowledge it until they saw me devour half a pan of chicken meat and eat several rice cakes only two hours afterwards. Then everyone suddenly became suspicious of me ever having had an ED. That does not really help me feel any better. I am pretty sure that I am also bloated as hell all the time, which is also a part of the process, but it also feels hella bad. The first two days or so I was kind of fine but now my ED thoughts are really starting to get to me again and shaming me for eating so much and I am trying my best not to let them win but I would like to know how long the extreme hunger phase lasted for you if you had it? Because holding the front lines against my ED is kind of hard.",

Please tell me if people can answer me without speaking. I do not know what is wrong with me and I do not want to go to a psychiatrist, if I am diagnosed with schizophrenia I will not be able to go to the military and I need the scholarship they give for volunteering.

I really encourage you to go to a doctor, I would not want things to get worse or more confusing for you. I am sorry this is happening to you. I hope everything works out for getting into the military or finding another career path. Also, I am pretty sure schizophrenia can only be treated by a doctor/medication.

Asking him to change to eat and feel exactly like you do about food is too much, but that is not what you are doing here. You are asking him to refrain from making comments about what you eat and to not dismiss you or mock you when you express your needs. He sounds childish. I would still think you need to go to couples counseling even if he did take kindly to you asking him to stop making comments about how you eat, because you both need to learn to navigate the fact that he is going to continue to diet and use behaviors that would not be helpful for you as a recovering person."

I would suggest trying bowel rest, which means choosing foods that are easy to digest: oatmeal, bananas, rice, apples/applesauce, toast with peanut butter, etc. This will give your bowels an opportunity to readjust to digestion, which is what you should probably be focused on right now \u2014 rest & digest + recovery.

These are unsubstantial things that probably no one else remembers about me but they absolutely haunt me. Does anyone else experience this? How do you cope with it?",
        "completion": "It is common for people to dwell on embarrassing memories because they can be emotionally charged. I personally have had this happened to me many times, mostly in periods of my life where my anxiety was more heightened. One way to cope with embarrassing memories is to practice self-compassion. This means being kind and understanding towards yourself when you have these thoughts, rather than criticizing or berating yourself. It can also be helpful to remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and has moments they are not proud of. It is not worth thinking too much about those moments, I promise you everyone has had embarrassing moments. Another strategy is to reframe the memory by focusing on the positives. For example, if the embarrassing memory is from a social situation, you might remind yourself of the friendships or connections you made in that situation, rather than dwelling on the specific mistake or embarrassment. You can also try to distract yourself when you find yourself dwelling on an embarrassing memory. Engaging in activities you enjoy can help you build more confidence, and this confidence will counteract or override the feelings of self consciousness over these memories. Focusing your time in and effort on practicing a hobby or doing a pleasant activity is key, because you will feel better afterwards with yourself too. Personally this is what helped me the most to stop dwelling in awkward memories. I hope this helps!"

We get along really well and I love her so much but recently i found out that she has anorexia. Some time ago i installed Tumblr and asked her if she could give me her username. I am pretty sure she Hestitated for some time but still gave me her username. When I saw her posts i literally froze. The whole account was about her anorexia, pictures of her body (She has visible bones everywhere) and starvation diet. Some time ago she did told me she had anorexia but i was sure it was all in the past. So i started asking her about it and everytime she posted something I could not have a normal conversation with her without saying something about her ED. I started wondering if maybe i should message her parents about it (From what i know she has a good relationship with them and they had to deal with her ED before) but i was scared she might get upset about it, so i told her I am considering talking to her parents. She was a bit upset and told me about her ex friend who actually told her parents about her ED and that when she found out about it she started to dislike that person. I really do not want to lose her but I just cannot stop worrying about it. So what should i do? I heard that telling her parents is a good option only if it is really bad with her but when is it,, really bad\"? (Sorry for any grammar mistakes)",
        "completion": "What comes to mind for me (as an adult) is that you can talk to your parents. Let them know what you saw, why you are concerned, etc. Getting help for minors is primarily an adult responsibility. What your parents choose to do with that information is up to them, and I think that your only responsibility in this is to remind your friend that you are here to be supportive of her getting the help she needs, with the understanding that it is likely professional help, and that as minors you guys cannot really do that without parental involvement. If your parents are not friends with each other, your parents can always contact a school guidance counselor who can pass along the concern, or they can reach out to them on facebook, etc. You can let her know how much the friendship means to you, how sad you would be if the ED took a larger and larger role in her life and got between the two of you, etc. but it is not your responsibility to care for her. I will say that it is likely that her parents are aware of the ED from what you have shared, but maybe not aware of this tumblr account. It sounds like something that is not helpful for her to have, but managing what is or is not allowed on her phone is part of the parents' responsibility."

My parents argued almost every day for 20+ years when I was growing up. Father alcoholic, had been trapped in a family with a woman, who was desperate for a family. I have been in therapy for over a year. I grew up in front of a computer and now I am working as a software engineer. I am an introvert and I have been alone for most of my life I feel the best when I am alone. I do have friends, but I generally do not go out. I moved to London, UK from continental Europe shortly before the pandemic and lockdowns started. I do not have friends in London and most of my day-to-day life I spend in the cycle: work-decompress-sleep-repeat. I spend weekends by myself, reading books, and watching movies, working on my hobby projects, traveling, and so on. People tell me, that this cycle of mine sounds depressing or not really doing me a great service. I do not find it depressing. I feel like it suits me and my needs. However, I am almost 30, and I never had a relationship. I would like to date, but everybody is telling me to just start socializing, and I cannot bring myself to do it. I do not feel like doing it, it does not sound like fun to me. People want to chat about stuff that I do not find amusing (soccer, F1, what is the latest fad on Netflix, and so on) and be \"entertained\". I am not entertaining. I am not the jester. I am a fairly shy/stern and serious person, which is the outermost layer of who I am. I do not let people in easily. I came to the age where I am just no longer trying to show off or to impress. The older I get the less I care about my life situation. I am also very goal-oriented, so if the activity is not having the effect I would expect then I would drop it. If I could jump straight into dating without socializing that would be my biggest dream. Dating apps are not doing me any favors.

He called my gp right away, since I have been on fluxitine. I feel so much better, and I have not had one of these episodes where I just have to leave a social event. And if I do feel a bit nervous I just tell my self most people do suck it up bitch get yay living or get busy dying. I am 30 now. I feel lucky I have reached that attitude at this age. I know so many women I speak to do not get to that stage until they are about 50. I just do not give a damn about stuff like that anymore. No one in the gym is watching me, and if they are so what probably jealous or watching my form or maybe they are lonely and want a friend. I feel great. Honestly, it is bit of give and take you got to want to take the mess and want to get better, and tell your self you will get better, I took about a month for mine to really help. But as long as you recognise yeh this is me I need help and I am going to take that help and use it to live my best damn life. You can do it. There is a great little book called the little book of cbt and you fill in the activities it really helped me too. Good luck! You got this."

They are typically not an indication of a psychotic disorder and are something that mentally healthy people experience as well. They also may be indicative of narcolepsy, or they might just occur on their own. That being said it seems like the nightmare experiences he is having are very distressing for him. There is treatment for Nightmare Disorder and night terrors and he could work with a therapist who is trained in such. I am not sure about for children but with adults it involves rehearsing how you will gain control in your nightmares and would think it would be similar in children.  As others have stated, the best thing to do is to first get a medical work up to rule out any medical issues that may be contributing to his symptoms and then go from there. Best of luck."

I never got taken to the doctor about it so was never diagnosed - this is more of a reassurance to you that it did not last forever.

The cycle is this: Restriction (I just will not eat much, then I will stay thin) leads to an intolerable desire for 'forbidden' foods ('trigger' foods, binge foods) which, once eaten, must be purged, leaving your body begging you for nutrition and hydration to heal itself, thus increasing your desire for those calorie-dense foods once more, even as you, now at the beginning again, attempt to return to your regular, restrictive eating. 7. You must interrupt this cycle at every step. 8. Do not restrict. No 'banned' foods. It is important to eat a couple of donut holes to show yourself that your weight will not spiral out of control, and that you can enjoy any food in moderation. 9. Do not binge. See above. Buy your food in smaller quantities or divide your meals into perfect portions while you are in early recovery, if this helps. 10. Do not purge. Even if you did binge.

I have always had a bad habit of picking repeatedly at scabs, pimples or the dry bits of skin around my fingernails (i do not know what that bit is called). I would not necessarily say that I do it excessively but I do it quite often. For example, in the past couple of weeks I have had a Band-Aid on at least one of my fingers almost every day. I pick at/bite at the dry skin on my fingers the most often and I do it at almost any time or for no particular reason. I have done it in movies or while I am scared or stressed. I do not always stop if it hurts or bleeds either. It is not a good habit I know and I am trying to break it but I figured that maybe if I try and understand it a bit better, I might be able l to prevent or at least reduce it.

Those actors and models have to go on extreme diets and be dehydrated for them to appear like that. It is not an attainable goal to have.

I would also recommend a healthy lifestyle if not living one already, drinking almost purely water, cold showers, eating a 3 coarse meal, finding some type of exercise (it does not matter, cardio, muscle, both). Building confidence with yourself will naturally take down some of the anxiety and for some it can take down all of it, this confidence in yourself allows you to intrusively think that you are in control thus leaving less anxiety. If you can take control of your bad habits and leave behind your good habits, you are in control with yourself. TLDR ; take control of yourself by letting yourself know that you are in control of a situation. Take control of bad habits and end them, and create good habits for yourself."

        "completion": "It sounds vague, and much easier said than done, but look into ways of changing your relationship with your anxiety. One of the things that makes anxiety so unpleasant is because we want so badly for it to not be there - to avoid it because it is so uncomfortable. Trying to avoid a problem always makes it seem way worse, right? But anxiety is a natural human emotion - it is not going to go away forever, and it is there to tell you something is wrong, it is just that you have become hyper sensitive. Try to make friends with it, recognise that it is not your enemy, but that it is there because it is trying to help to protect you, but it is going a bit overboard. If you can try to get to the root of your anxiety it will help you understand it better - perhaps some sort of therapy if medication is not helping. You will likely find there is a root to do with feeling very unsafe and having a lack of control, and there will be ways to help take the edge off the anxiety. I would also recommend trying meditation for anxiety, a simple one to try is putting your hand on your abdomen, and repeating to yourself the words \u201cI am safe\u201d. If you have access to any, maybe look at doing a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy course, or trying short mindfulness meditation in general where you can focus on learning to be more present so you are not running away with anxious thoughts as often. Anxiety is a real hard one to tackle and I suffer with it chronically - totally understand the exhaustion of every part of life feeling like wading through mud. Please try to get some therapy or as a start, a book - try \u201covercoming anxiety\u201d by Helen kennerly - teaches how to use CBT and it might be a good starting point to help you understand the thought-feeling-behaviour loop around anxiety and ways to break it.

Most people with anxiety disorders do better with therapy (CBT) than with medicine, and some are successful with self-help based on CBT. I can show you some CBT self-help but first I want to say that recently there has been very impressive evidence for therapeutic breathing. When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There is two ways to get rid of those thoughts. One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each. When you are calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Do not make mountains out of molehills. When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better. Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes. The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication. Do not overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety. Video - a lot of helpful information, including the 3-part program of Brown and Gerbarg - "

I do not know if you are open to spirituality, there are likely many ways of coping.. But for myself, a meditative practice of daily reflections from a place of patience, compassion, no judgment can help create a cycle that opens us up and heals our inner being"

You will find yourself smiling at life. It is too good for words, It is quiet but huge. I have had a few moments when I suddenly realized that I was genuinely feeling happy and I just had a good happy cry over it. I want you to experience that.

I saw on discord how people do a bunch of stuff with bots and their alters. In theory it sounds like it works. But each, that is so much effort and its unrealistic. What really happens is you just go missing from your normal Online spaces when it is an alter. Because they have different things they care about. I do not know maybe I am different than most or something. Maybe multiple of them want to use discord, who knows. Anyway at the same time I have had an alter message an online friend before. They said weird stuff but did not introduce themselves. Also they had a reason. It was not just because \"oh I am so and so\" Also it almost ruined my friendship and I had no excuse. I was not just going to pull the \"was not me\" card and make things 100 times worse. I Do Not Know I am just mad maybe. Seen a lot of very fake stuff lately and it is wild. I do not know I feel like most people are not faking on purpose though. Long story short, it is possible they are not faking. But I am highly cautious of people online that say they have it. Just see how it goes I guess. It tries to hide itself to some degree, but irl it is not very hidable in general. Even if people do not know what is up with you, they will definitely think something is wrong. It makes work and life very hard. I feel like most people who actually have DID do not get access to the internet. So there is that. Sadly it is hard to tell the difference. Even if your friend is \"lying\" it is probably not intentionally. I do not know if this is helpful at all, but goodluck."

And the type of trauma one has to go through to get it (which can only happen in childhood by the way) is so extreme that most of the world can say they have not experienced anything that bad. This is why most people who have it for real were in some kind of situation where their parents were in an evil cult that tortures children or were victims of human trafficking as children or some other situation that is extreme like that. Edit: also I would like to add that before it was \"trendy\", I only had spoken to one person in my whole life who has it, and she came from the first situation I described, literally was kidnapped for mind control experiments as a kid. Most people will never meet anyone with this condition. It is actually disgusting how tiktok picked up on it and turned it into a roleplay thing for attention which has irreversibly tainted the credibility of people who have it for real, and by the way, the real thing is nothing like what they think it is and it is not cute or fun."

Only discovered it then, as before I concentrated on athletic endeavors (all of which failed, by the way, despite being good enough to play for my school's soccer and tennis teams). But suddenly I had something real to hang onto. I got a music scholarship to college, was selected to represent said college for a year as part of an international chorus in Germany, and was also selected to study in an opera program in Austria. I also was trying to build a resume to attempt to break into film acting. I seemed to have an excellent chance for either of those, but anxiety and depression always held me back. I started drinking at a very early age because of it. When I was 15, I discovered the \"joy\" of heroin. I continued on these diverging paths for years, even achieving a professional gig with my city's philharmonic orchestra. But eventually, drugs won. Helped tremendously by either bipolar or BPD. My psychiatrist cannot decide which it actually is. May be time to find a new psychiatrist. I had a life. I had a career. But I lost it all. But I am clean for almost two years now and hoping to God I can get at least one of them back. But, at the age of 38, I fear it may be too late."

When it comes to homework, a \u201cnormal\u201d person can finish 10 problems in around 2-3 hours (physics problems) and it takes me twice as long.

I wish people understood the textbook symptoms AND the non textbook niche ones. When I was at my worst I could not brush my teeth, ate once a day (not even a full meal), I sit down In the shower for 20 minutes and zone out, wear the same clothes for a week, lose interest in all the things I absolutely love, I will read a paragraph and take in zero information. There is the Intrusive thoughts of self harm, and so much more. As stated in another comment, I wish people did not give stereotypical advice like \u201chave you tried exercising, or changing your diet?\u201d Or even worse some people straight up say \u201cjust be happy, what do you have to be sad about?\u201d It is not about being sad or needing a reason to be, it is about a numbness, being tired, feeling alone sitting right next to your closest friends and not knowing why, staring into the void and it staring right back. I am doing so much better now and I am more open about it than I use to be. But it does not go away, and it cannot be healed. It can only be treated."

Bi-weekly appointments are not enough when you have not worked in 6 months because of your illness. The stigma of an \"invisible\" illness or disability. The unrecognized urgency and need for care. Cancer has stages of urgency and intervention protocols that suit each stage. Depression does not seem to have stages and depends on the same treatment protocol with little deviation depending on severity, i.e. when you are an inpatient your care protocol is still medications and psychotherapy the difference being you are in a supervised more structured environment. The \"stages\" I recognize and experience are Functional and In-Patient. It does not seem to matter if you experience new or worse inf suicidal ideation, you lose or gain 20lbs, you cannot sleep and your responsibilities nevermind leaving the house become impossible.

        "completion": "Huh. Huge coincidence. After dinner yesterday, I journaled an entry literally titled \u201cWhat I wish they understood\u201d. Maybe that was triggered by me scrolling past your post on Reddit last night. Here you go: Depression is a huge, descriptive\u2014not prescriptive\u2014umbrella term. It means little to nothing objectively. It is not as simple as what it boils down to. Maybe it is a chemical imbalance, maybe it is inherited because all my living and deceased immediate and extended family members struggle(d) with depression. Experientially, it is a subconscious revolt against the disgusting, unjust, artificial world we inhabit. The human mind is built to impose its own supernarrative on the entropic, orderless expanse of protons, neutrons, and electrons bouncing around each other that we call the world. I do not see how people are not depressed. Perhaps they ought to be. When my friends try to understand my depression, they seem to see me as the one deviating from the norm. I see them as the outsiders. I have gotten to a point in my life where my depression, while incredibly painful, is not so debilitating to my daily life or my job. I see my depression as the result of several incongruities between myself and my vision of the world. This yields the problem. Would antidepressants help me? Probably. I am aware of the mostly minimal side-effects of SSRIs, and my medication history indicates I would have little to no problem on most SSRIs. I prefer this though. I exist painfully and see a kind of disdainful beauty in the world. For better or worse, the human mind is a creator of beauty. All beauty, whether natural or manmade, is created by the mind. They are projections of the internal patterns of thought built through eons of evolution paired with a coincidentally sentient brain. I can and routinely do enjoy that beauty, but I do not deserve to. No one truly deserves anything; no cosmic justice exists to deliver us from the evils of ourselves. I routinely self-sabotage, and that still proves a detriment to my daily life. My career is doing well, but I would be so much further if I did not self-sabotage. At the core, I feel no more worthy of the accoutrements of life I possess than those who do not possess the same. There was a year in my late childhood where I withstood the tropical heat with no AC and no fridge. I genuinely miss those days. Back then, it was just daily suffering of a kind I could stomach much more easily. Now, my apartment comes with its own fridge, and heat and AC are included in the rent What a change But I revile it. Why me? Why should I receive this when others do not? I worked hard and was privileged to be surrounded by people who helped me even though I did not want to be helped. I deserve my current life no more than a kid mining cobalt in the DRC. Really, this is a long-winded way of saying I hate the human mind. We think we are not selfish, but we prefer to care for ourselves and our families\u2014just because we associate with them for long periods and have shared genetic material. I have a very analytical friend who is never struggled with his mental health. When I describe to him what my depression consists of, his eyebrows furrow as he tries understand what it is that is wrong with me. It is ironic, because I think similarly of everyone else who can just meander through life, pursuing their own goals and prioritizing their own happiness because they have an arbitrary sense of self-deserving. I feel as though I have to act outwardly that I am like that as well, but right below the surface I think\u2014God damn, what the hell is wrong with everyone else?"

A week went by, and she stopped talking to me; reinforcing my belief that she did not care. I got even more furious. feelings grew and I started becoming trapped in my own thoughts certain she was thinking \u2018this\u2019 about me. I am terrible at communicating so it started lingering more and more. Eventually, I just told her to block me since I could not tell her my true feelings. I was having a mental breakdown and she had no idea what was going on and had enough and blocked me. And of course, I regretted it right away. I cannot even give her closure properly. The only thing I can do is leave a voice message or walk to her house. But I feel like that will make things worse. I HATE holding a grudge or not settling beef. What should I do?",
        "completion": "I do not truly understand the entirety of the situation, but I can recommend that you do not show up to her house unannounced - especially if she lives alone. I have been in a similar situation and I can promise that is not the direction to take. I am not sure what could have happened that made her upset, but if she blocked you, try to give it some time to cool down. Then maybe try to contact her via email/text however you can and just try to explain what happened. Usually being upfront and vulnerable with someone will get you a lot further. Do not get too caught up in your head love. We all have moments. We are human and life has been really hard lately. Take a deep breath and leave things be for a second. Get your thoughts together and then try and reach out. Wishing you luck! I promise it is not the end all be all. If she wishes not to speak to you anymore, than she was not intended to stay in your life. Trust me, I know that is hard, but if that is the case, in time you will understand why. \ud83c\udf39"

        "prompt": "Is it weird that I cannot take criticism? - I have always been a sensitive person who cannot take constructive criticism or any criticism. I hate to be yelled at or talked to in a sharp tone. It makes me fall into tears with doubts about who I am. Is this normal?",
        "completion": "I used to be able to take criticism pretty easily, brush it off no problem. But in the last few years since my self esteem has been quite a bit lower, I get way more triggered by criticism than I ever used to. It is basically that a certain belief has been activated 'eg. I am not good enough', and so I will feel it a lot more now than I used to. Something similar might be happening for you. How to fix it? Do not know, I am still working with it myself. Some things to experiment with: 1. Self Compassion 2. Exposing yourself purposely to criticism/rejection and showing yourself that you can handle it 3. Shame attacking exercises - do random stuff in public and show that people do not really reject you, and even if they do, you can handle it 4. Becoming more assertive 5. Valuing yourself - highlighting all your good and positive qualities to yourself every day. Building yourself up bit by bit every day 6. Allow the feelings of sensitivity to rise and fall as it happens, and continuing to behave in whatever way you would want to whether the thoughts and feelings were there or not 7. Embrace and accept your sensitivity completely, it is a pretty beautiful quality anyway. It stops you being a jerk to other people and means you have got an increased capacity for care for others too, all of which are great qualities"

        "completion": "Its normal if you were critized/blamed as a kid much. If you did not feel save to express your authentic self. If you had to hide parts of yourself to be loved. If you were only loved if you would performed. If you pleased your parents because you were afraid of them getting mad. It leaves wounds that are triggered in adult life. These wounds or traumas can heal, but it takes time and probably therapy. Your body remembers rejection/critisism as something very painful. Your brain is a computer that works automatically on pattern. It recognizes rejection and it will present to you an automatic negative and painful feeling. If you find yourself reacting overdone or extreme in relative normal situations, you prob have a unhealed wound or trauma. Therapy can help you with it And it all starts with becoming aware of this. \"Woow i feel so much pain in my heart when a friend critisizes me\" \"i feel pain in my heart and i am now caring for myself\" \"this is triggered because in the past this was hurtful to me\" \"now i am a caple adult and i can handle my pain and this situation\" \"i can comfort myself now\" Hopefully this helps"

You can however choose to not date people that smoke. I have boundaries around my relationship with my mother. I cannot change her, but I can choose to stop engaging with her if she crosses a boundary I have set for behavior I will accept or not. It can feel like imposing a rule or trying to control someone when they hear that you will not do something if they do something, but life is about choices and when you decide you do not do something if they do, they then have the ability to choose to be with you and conform to your boundary, or decide they would rather do the thing you do not want and not be with you."

I have depression and anxiety among other things, and 10 years ago I began to completely lose my appetite and be unable to eat whenever I was under extra stress or extreme distress. Once the extra stress was gone, my appetite would return. Then, 5 years ago, after a time of extended and prolonged trauma, in which my appetite vanished, it simply never came back. My type of depression is anhedonia, meaning I cannot feel pleasure, enjoyment or interest in things. I am always bored and empty. I sleep all day. I have not eaten in the day for years and if I try, I feel sick and it goes right through me within 30 minutes. I resent people who need to eat lunch. It feels so foreign to me. I feel like a robot who never needs food. My stomach never rumbles, gurgles or feels anything. It is like it is switched off and numb, like my ability to feel interest in anything. When I used to lose my appetite directly from stress, I would drop lots of weight very quickly (and I was already slim) as I could not eat at all and just survived by sipping juice and iced tea, but nowadays, the only reason I am not underweight is because I binge eat chocolate, donuts, cookies, and everything sugary and sweet every night about midnight. It is the time I feel less anxious and can just zone out and watch Netflix or something, and stuff myself with sugar. Looking back, I then realised I have never eaten much during the day, and as a kid, I had issues eating breakfast and also lunch at school, due to anxiety. I could never finish my dinner either, though I could eat chocolate and cakes as my snacks after dinner, as again, at night time I was more relaxed. Is this an eating disorder?

See  for a good explanation of this. I have a hard time explaining this to people, but analogies seem to work. You would never walk into a Pizza Hut asking \"is this a place that makes pizzas?\" before ordering your pizza because that is awkward. Same thing for me when it comes to asking (or being asked) questions. If I do not have all the details in front of me, my anxiety says \"nope, time to shut down.\" Combine the above with overthinking everything in situations where most people would not even think if what they just said was slightly offensive, and it is like there are roadblocks everywhere for me.

There is no way I could ask somebody who I enjoy like a coworker if they want to come hang out, The idea is just way too scary to me. When I was in school I was always a straight A student and teacher's pet, But now in the real world I cannot push myself to do anything that I thought I would be doing because of anxiety. I had a lot of ambitions for myself. None of them have been realized. I basically just sit at home and mope all day. I have been severely depressed my whole life, because of the knowledge that I cannot communicate with other people like other people communicate with other people. I am a talented person at the things I do. But I do not let those things leave my house. I consider my anxiety crippling. I will likely never sell my art, never push the career that I dreamt of. I have a job, But I cannot work full time. I am too afraid that I am going to let people down from being sick or in pain or being depressed. The idea of letting people down is in the back of my mind constantly. People often consider me to be very weird. And I think that stems down to not knowing what to say or do in social environments. If it was not for an old high school acquaintance I would have never started my seasonal job, haunted house working. I am proud of myself for just staying there for the past 7 years. Especially since that person has not been there for many years so I do not have anybody there. I sit in the corner and stay by myself. I smile at people's conversations and listen to what they have to say, But I always feel if I butt into the conversation that I am just going to be some sort of parasite on it. The thing is that people act like they like me there. But if they are not going to initiate a friendship with me I am not going to initiate it with them. I have been told by so many people at the haunted house that I am an amazing actress and that I should push to do it professionally. But I will never go to an audition unless somebody goes with me. And that is not going to happen because I do not know anybody. I have tried to go back to school a few times. But I am already so much older than everybody else in the classes that I feel like I do not belong. And I know that that is a fake idea that I have made up. But it does not stop the fact that it is stopping me. I do not have a relationship with my family because I am afraid to talk to them because I have anxiety when I do. I used to spend family activities crying in the bathroom instead of communicating with people that love me. I am socially awkward on top of that, and I have an issue with communication. I just never know what to say and I think I always say the wrong thing. People do not seem to even want to hear me talk so I am interrupted all the time. And I do not know how to stand my ground in that situation. But of course they do not want to hear me talk because everything that seems to come out of my mouth is nonsense. I actually deal with it well professionally. I can talk to strangers perfectly fine. If I am under the assumption that I am not going to see somebody again or if we are only talking to each other in a professional manner I am a perfectly able human being. I am a very friendly waitress, My customers love me, back in my retail days I could sell the shoes off your feet. But if I want you to like me, personally, you are not going to. I will not give you the choice to. On top of that both of my parents are pretty much me. Same disorders, same issues. And they are from that older generation that considers all of that to just be normal. And so when I tried to tell them a young age that I was not normally just shook it off. So it is hard for me not to blame them knowing that I could have been better with childhood therapy and support. That also probably stands for me not being able to talk to my parents, because they did not listen when I needed them to. PSA for parents out there. If your child tells you they are weird and they do not like it, listen to them. They know their own mind better than you could ever. I am suicidal. And I completely blame my social anxiety for it. My instinct for not liking what words came out of my mouth is planning how I am going to kill myself. It has become a daily invasive thought for so many years I cannot remember when it started. I do not hurt myself and I do not want to hurt myself. But every time I make toast, I think about putting a knife in there. When I shave my legs I think about cutting my wrists. I am incredibly lucky to have my partner of 13 years, who puts up with my broken mind. With my inability to function at full-time job, I would most likely be homeless if it was not for him. I do not think I will ever be able to live alone. I would give up on things like electricity, because I might have to make a phone call to an actual human being about fixing something. Phones are actually the worst. I cannot talk on a phone to anybody but my dad and partner. It immediately makes me shake and I start scratching myself. I only call my mom on days where I feel \"healthy\". Calling her after work is the best because I am still in a professional mindset. I do significantly better socially after I have been talking to the customers for hours. And my favorite part, (definitely the worst part) is that I overshare with people I get comfortable with. And that often pushes people away. But I cannot even help myself I just start hearing the words come out of my mouth and I cannot shut up. So if you are my co-worker and you are friendly to me, you might hear my life story. And then I will be afraid to ever talk to you again. Anyway thanks for the question. They gave me a reason for a long winded rant."

It must have been a very difficult time for her and for all you know she might even be sad she could not love her body enough to take photos during that special time. Pointing it out to her is only going to make things worse for her. It is best to just acknowledge there are a lot of triggers that come with pregnancy and postpartum when you have an ED and just respect her wishes when it comes to the words you use and the questions you ask.

My ED was caused by my moms obsession with my weight. Weekly weight checks, food restrictions, forced vomiting, etc. I hate pictures of myself. I have virtually zero pictures of myself pregnant and I have had two kids. My daughter is now 12 and a skinny, little dancer worried about her weight. People called her chubby from birth because I never restricted her like my mom restricted me. Then relatives calling her \u201cbig\u201d because she is the only grandkid on the growth chart. Why comment on baby fat? Just say that they are cute! After having kids, I am 5\u20192\u201d and 105lbs without an eating disorder. She is an inch shorter and 90lbs. Apparently, she inherited my body type. Go easy on your friend. I was proud to have healthy babies and did not want people talking about their weight. Maybe I was over sensitive about the words people used describing my daughter, but I would do anything to avoid the trauma I went through."

It can also be deadly by stopping alcohol suddenly. Cocaine and meth, you just sleep off the withdraws and it is tolerable, but heroin you get sick and vomit, diarrhea, cold sweats, you name it. Coming off of heroin, I would recommend methadone or suboxone by going to a clinic and having them taper you gradually over time.

I have a history of substance abuse myself, but I have never been physically addicted to anything more than caffeine and nicotine. I have \"relapsed\" on the caffeine many times and not had much of a problem with the \"physical\" addiction (except fatigue from withdrawals). As far as the nicotine, once I finally came clean of that; I never looked back.

If you can afford it, I would recommend getting a blood test to see if any of your vitamin/mineral/etc levels are lower than they should be. I feel a million times better when I remember to take my iron, vit c, and vit d tablets. But remember that if you are not lacking a certain vitamin, taking that vitamin will do nothing for you. For example, if your vitamin c levels are fine but you take vit c tablets anyway, you will literally just piss out the excess. Which is why I recommend the blood test so you are not taking something unnecessarily. Also, unironically, make jokes about how cool you are. Even if you do not believe them. Stumble when you are walking? say something like \"wow, look how smooth I am today!\" instead of \"guess I am so dumb I cannot even walk straight\". Yes it will be sarcastic. No, you will not believe it. But those posts you may have seen on social media about repeating these things over and over again (even if you do not mean them) were right. If you say positive things jokingly, it is easier to hear and internalise positive things seriously. I spent YEARS thinking this was bullshit until I started doing it.

        "completion": "I live for my daughter ... and myself, because I am worth it too. I struggled majorly with ADHD, MDD, GAD, addiction, and SI in my early 20's, I worked really hard to drop bad habits, develop positive self-talk and tools to help navigate life. I grew leaps and bounds, had my daughter when I was 32, struggled with some PPD and PPA and then the pandemic hit, I lost my dad to cancer and my relationship with my daughter's father ultimately ran it is course - and I now I am a single mom, working as a Psych nurse doing shift work. It is fucking hard, and some days I find my brain slipping back into old thought patterns, mainly \"I wish I were dead.\" Not active SI but passive. Although, when I used to have these thoughts, before I had my daughter, there was not immense guilt associated with it. Now I acknowledge the thought, and talk myself through it, give myself grace, and remind myself that despite all the nasty crap I have been through, I am still here. I am capable of getting through tough times. I have navigated shitty times before, and I can navigate this - I have to, for my daughter, I want to see her grow and learn. She has taught me so much. I could not leave her here without a mom. And by no means am I shaming anyone who has died by suicide, parent or not. I understand that in order to take one's life, they are in immense emotional pain. So, I live for my daughter and I live for the good times that are to be had in this life. Funny enough, I think about the quote from Butters (South Park) \"Well yeah, and I am sad, but at the same time I am really happy that something could make me feel that sad. It is like, it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt something really good before.\" - Which is spot on for myself, but may not resonate with others There is also the Carl Jung quote: \"Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.\""

But now I am 17, and I do not want my parents to have access to this info. I do not remember signing any releases, but it was a couple years ago. Further, my mom works at the hospital, and she is been friends with my therapist for several years. My parents pay for my therapy if that matters. Anyway, sometimes I share something with my therapist and then it seems to come up in conversations with my parents. Like maybe they will not bring it up directly and it may be a few days after, but it is always a little weird when they do. I do not want to stop therapy, and I think I am better because of therapy. That said, I need to protect my privacy. Does it sound like I am overthinking? If I ask my therapist about it, will that impact my relationship with her? Should I ask my parents about it? I do not way to accuse anyone of anything, I just do not know what to do. I am just going to add that my parents have been worried about my mental health. I am nowhere near where I was when I was 15, but my parents frequently ask me about it. It actually played a role in the university I am going to since my parents do not want me going somewhere far away. I am literally going to a state university that is about 20 minutes away from them.",
        "completion": "Even as a minor, your therapist should not share details about your sessions with your parents. From a professional standpoint, this violates the therapist/patient relationship. It is also a conflict of interest for your therapist to be friends with your parents. It does not matter whether your parents pay for your therapy; you have the right to keep your therapy sessions private. You are not overthinking. Maybe this therapist is not telling your parents everything. Your parents may be bringing up things from your therapy sessions due to queues you are unconsciously giving or out of coincidence. I would still strongly consider switching therapists. You should have a therapist that is not a friend of your parents and is outside of the hospital network that your mother works for. If your therapist is a professional, they will keep their emotions out of the equation and encourage you to do what you think is best for your mental health. Even if they are perfectly innocent of what you think might be happening, the fact that you think it is happening is damaging enough to the therapist/patient to warrant finding a new therapist. You need to be able to feel comfortable telling them anything without fearing the judgement of others; you cannot do that if you suspect that they are telling your parents everything."

I do not know you, and neither have I any idea what you will make of what I am about to type, but I will try to keep it breezy, as much as I can. A couple of years back, my state of mind is where I feel yours is now. I procrastinated it for a whole year before finally getting to it. The thought of not existing anymore. There was a lot of stress in life, and nothing was going in the right direction. The procrastination part was the hope against the hope, that my fate, or someone will come save me from my situation and thoughts. No one came. Pressures rose every day. So, when I planned it finally after remaining hopeless in all forms of human existence, it gave me so much happiness that I cannot explain to this day. But, three days before I had planned it, a primal urge to do it sooner made me feel utterly depressed. I walked for a very long time and told myself to remember this lowest feeling, and that I ever felt even close to this feeling, I will do everything to get away from it. Music, Meditation, Long walks, Nature and unconditional love is healing, I found later. Now I live my life with 'one moment at a time'. It is hard to apply it to every moment, but I try my best and always keep my mood right. So, I went through a deeply manic depressive phase (hating humanity and myself) right after the decision to not to do it. This phase changed my life. I realized there are so many people out there who are suffering much more than I am, and there is no point being hopeless about life, it has what I have. I have what I do in each moment. And the only and hardest thing to do was to manage my own mood. My triggers are as simple as thirst, hunger, unmet expectations (expressed and unexpressed, from myself and others), weird vibes (energy senses) etc. Keeping them in check is hard, but meditation and keeping a comfort zone for myself at all times is what helps. What helps more is to have a personal goal everyday. I like reading, watching independent style films, listening to all genre's of old and new music, skateboarding, playing ping pong, and writing stories. I still work a simple 'behind the counter' job to sustain myself. I am doing good now. I am proud of myself like never before. I had never thought I could leave the thought of not existing behind, but I have. and it feels amazing every time I remember it because it feels like a very personal victory over death, which eventually will come anyways. I know my experiences and reasoning can never match any other human being's or yours, but what I am trying to say essentially is that there is a lot within all of us. Do not look outside, but look within first (meditation helps, chose a personal favorite style of it, and do it for yourself). Unconditional love, respect and peace."

I have an extremally difficult relationship with food. As a small kid, I was very picky and vomited without inducing various times each month. My teachers and relatives tried to make me eat, but I always refused or they forced me and I vomited. They tried it for YEARS without sucess, so they all just gave up so I could at least eat something. In middle school (keep in mind I am not from US). I have eat only noodles or bread daily. Yes, I had the condition to eat more than that, do not worry, I just did not eat because I did not felt like eating or was not hungry enough. In one part of middle school and high school I was in a school that I was 7 am but got there 6am and got out 5pm, got home almost 6pm. I did not ate before going and I refused to eat all three meals they offered. In some days, almost never, can count in hands, brought a cookie to eat. Sometimes I gave it away, sometimes I ate only half. I got nausea and gagged when people ate around me, because of the smell of the food, because of the sight of someone eating, because of the vision of the fork moving in the disgusting food. It makes me sick. My mom did not let me use the stove, so I could not make food for myself, either. However, I never wanted to cook, what would I make anyway? I am still very picky. I still gag and want to vomit when people eat or when there is food around me. I ate a bit more and not only noodles and bread, even though bread is still my \"main food\". Last year one of my teachers asked me about it, because pretty much all my school staff knows I have problems with food. I told her. She said that she is like that too. That she has an eating disorder. I have anxiety so that is stuck in my mind. I do not have problems with my body, weight, face, hair and/or clothes. Yeah, some very small insecurities that go away very fast, but I do not really care about it. I was judged a bit when I was younger, but honestly? I do like how I look. Wish I was taller, but have nothing to do with an ED and I cannot change it. That said, it is even possible to have an ED without having appearance problems?

My teachers and relatives tried to make me eat, but I always refused or they forced me and I vomited. They tried it for YEARS without sucess, so they all just gave up so I could at least eat something. In middle school (keep in mind I am not from US). I have eat only noodles or bread daily. Yes, I had the condition to eat more than that, do not worry, I just did not eat because I did not felt like eating or was not hungry enough. In one part of middle school and high school I was in a school that I was 7 am but got there 6am and got out 5pm, got home almost 6pm. I did not ate before going and I refused to eat all three meals they offered. In some days, almost never, can count in hands, brought a cookie to eat. Sometimes I gave it away, sometimes I ate only half. I got nausea and gagged when people ate around me, because of the smell of the food, because of the sight of someone eating, because of the vision of the fork moving in the disgusting food. It makes me sick. My mom did not let me use the stove, so I could not make food for myself, either. However, I never wanted to cook, what would I make anyway? I am still very picky. I still gag and want to vomit when people eat or when there is food around me. I ate a bit more and not only noodles and bread, even though bread is still my \"main food\". Last year one of my teachers asked me about it, because pretty much all my school staff knows I have problems with food. I told her. She said that she is like that too. That she has an eating disorder. I have anxiety so that is stuck in my mind. I do not have problems with my body, weight, face, hair and/or clothes. Yeah, some very small insecurities that go away very fast, but I do not really care about it. I was judged a bit when I was younger, but honestly? I do like how I look. Wish I was taller, but have nothing to do with an ED and I cannot change it. That said, it is even possible to have an ED without having appearance problems?

I would highly recommend seeing someone who specializes in EDs. I have struggled with some avoidant/restrictive behaviors around food myself, and for me, it is been really helpful to find neutral meal replacements that I can stomach. Stuff like Soylent, high-protein vanilla pudding, granola bars, stuff that tastes the same every time and does not have a bad texture for me. But especially if you are being affected by even seeing other people eat, you should look into treatment, because it could really improve your quality of life."

Can you journal and write what it must feel like from your friend/lover\u2019s perspective after your feelings \u201cjust stops.\u201d If you cannot, then talk to a psychologist, and perhaps you have a mental disorder that could be treated. 2) Are you on SSRI\u2019s? While I am not saying do not be on prescribed meds, there is a study that has shown that a SSRI tends correlate with people, who are always chasing that novel excitement feeling of a first date. And if it is related to medication, talk to your doctor to see if anything else can be done. Most people develop feelings, as time goes on, and I wish that for you. Good luck to you"

        "completion": "I suggest looking into Internal Family Systems therapy to help with this. Main takeaway is not to demonize any self harm thoughts but to listen to them with curiosity and compassion. You can investigate why you want to kill yourself and see the good in that intention like maybe you are trying to save yourself from misery or permanent pain, and then from that same calm space, you can thank yourself for caring to prevent pain but state that the plan is self preservation over self harm. The intrusive thoughts can come from not having dialogue between that calm, most current/ present version of you and those parts of you that are hurting more and carrying pain. Just trust that you can hold space to love yourself and create that internal safety in your dialogue. From your comments/post: Part A: fear of being suicidal; demonizing that like saying you are scared of going \u201cinsane\u201d Part B: suicidal; probably really hurting and trying to show you an escape route you clung to before learning healthier coping skills You can speak to these parts of you and offer compassion and understanding and listen without trying to change them. Understanding the positive intent can make the thoughts less scary while also allowing you to calmly decide not to act on those thoughts- like if you understand the suicidal thought is coming from insecurity and wanting to not feel insecure, you can reason with that part of you that insecurity is not permanent, so you will not react with a permanent solution. That is just an example. Sending love and healing your way. Keep it up on the asking for help part. \ud83d\udc95"

        "prompt": "Med changes for bulimia? - Sorry in advance for the long post... I started seeing a new psychiatrist in December and she also specialises in eating disorders. I did not go to her specifically for my bulimia, but figured it was a nice perk. In our first session, I told her all the meds I was on, which included Olanzapine (10mg) and Mirtazapine (45mg), which had been recently increased during my last inpatient admission last year. I also gave a general history of what I have been diagnosed with, which is when I mentioned the bulimia. She asked me if I was a smoker (which I am) and how much do I smoke. When I told her she said that when someone is smoking as much as I do, it basically nullifies any therapeutic benefits of Olanzapine only leaving me with the side effects which include weight gain and increased appetite. So she gave me a plan for the following 3 weeks to come off it. She also wanted me to start using Recovery Record again (eating disorder logging app) and link her to my profile so she can see how I am going, since she was concerned about how often I said I was binging and purging. Which was no problem for me since I already am logging everything on Lose It anyway. (I have actually been finding it interesting/helpful being able to log my moods, thoughts, behaviours, and urges as well). During our second appointment on the 27.01, she said that she knew from what I had explained during the last appointment that the bulimia was a significant issue, but she did not realise how bad it actually is. That everytime she reviews her patient's on Recovery Record, I am always at the top of her list and always in the red. She asked me again if I would consider another eating disorder admission (first/last time I did an ED admission was in 2016) and I told her no. She then said that she wants to take me off Mirtazapine as soon as possible. That because it significantly increases appetite and weight gain, that it was making everything even worse (apparently vets use Mirtazapine on animals that need to gain weight for various reasons, including due to cancer... which blew my mind!). That even though the CPTSD is the primary issue, that the binging and purging was making my anxiety and depression symptoms worse, which then feeds into the eating disorder, and it is just a vicious cycle. Her hope is that by coming off the Mirtazapine and starting a new medication, it will help with one piece of the puzzel. She explained that it was not going to get rid of the eating disorder, but maybe if I am not having as often and stronge urges to binge, that I will not be purging as much as I do. She actually seemed a bit frustrated that I was not only put on these medications in the first place, but that they increased my doses during my last admission since I have a history of eating disorders. SO (lot of background for this one question, sorry), she instead wants to put me on Vyvanse. She said that it is an ADHD medication (which my psychologist is very interested in me trying because she thinks I have ADD), but it has been used to help manage Binge Eating Disorder. Since I am binging, it should help with these symptoms. Has anyone been put on Vyvanse to combat bulimia/BED? Have you found it helpful or not? I did a quick google and it does say it has been used for binge eating disorder but am curious to hear other's anecdotal evidence. If you made it to the end... I am impressed haha thank you",

So I wanted to make as much money as possible, problem was I had horrible anxiety. I held a ton of dead end jobs till I started working at aviation facility. Saved up money, bought a house in cash, had girlfriend that was my wife to be. Life was good. Than all of it changed. Management changed at work, GF cheated, house kind of got ruined blah blah. I did not like any part of my life. Found a new position at work which is okay. Than I started over. When I was young I remember I wanted to join the military. Now that I have experienced stress and a life reset, I am certain I can get/do the things I want. Time to sign up and sell/rent the house. Please realize you are not locked into any life path because you tried. I had a major fear of picking the wrong job/career/partner. I know now that if does not work out you just keep going. Failure is not that big of a deal but not trying is (to me) a waste. If you are worried because there is something you want to do but you are not rising up to the challenge due to fear, yes find the courage. To not do anything is the most expensive thing you can do in your life, and I am not talking about money. I played hours of PC games, (league of legends ect), I played probably 2.5 years in just gameplay hour alone. So I get it. If this a life style your okay with than, enjoy. If your gut is telling you to get busy than make a goal with a deadline and get to it. Do not avoid change."

This is mostly behavioural, but things like incels and the manosphere prey on depressed vulnerable males, especially youths, and radicalize them against women.

Personally, I do not have issues surrounding food and I do not want to sound insensitive so please correct me if I do at any point, but I just want some advice. My girlfriend has bulimia and I am so grateful she can and does talk to me about her daily struggles . She is honestly one of the strongest people I know and I will never be able to fully understand what she goes through everyday. I do not want to sound selfish but I want to know if there is anything at all that I can do. I feel useless when I listen to her talk without being able to do anything to help her.

Some of you might say that my presence is enough but I also want to know what is the right way to respond to her when she talks to me about her ed. It is difficult because I do not feel what she is going through and as a result it is hard to treat and respond to her like it is something which she cannot control, even though I know she does not have control over the bingeing, purging and everything else. Her bingeing and purging is everyday and she is so tired of having to do it as well as the insufferable pain that results. She wants to aim for not bingeing and purging for a week but has no clue how to do that. She asked me this despite knowing I would not have an answer, she just wanted to express her difficulties. Her thought process right now is just to eat less/only eat \"healthy\" (i put quotations because her and I have different definitions of eating healthy) because she knows she will not feel bad and feel the need to purge. She believes there is more harm done to her body if she purges compared to if she just ate less... I do not know how to help her so right now I am just here for her. To sum it up, I am wondering what is a good way to reply to her when she talks to me about her ed and if any of you guys have more suggestions on how she could meet her goal?",

So it is not that things have necessarily changed. You just have been doing them for longer. Everything will lose its shine with age so the sensible solution is to find new experiences in life. Of course, job is not going anywhere, and yes, for majority of us it is a dreadful thing. But new things do not have to be expensive or bougie. I.e \"oh, I am bored, I am going to go on a retreat to Malta for a week.\" Learning new skill - playing a music instrument, drawing, pottery - is not only a great way to engage those neurons and be genuinely happy about learning and discovering something new.

The thing I realized when I was almost choking to death because of the ligature, life would not notice if I were gone. Only the people that care would. And I needed to be here to make a difference in their lives. Even when I thought I was completely unloved and unlovable, I knew that if I gave up, I would lose the respect and love of those people, all the ones that I had but did not know, and all those that I had yet to meet, because of one decision that I could use to cheat the system and get out of something that hurt me.

Lazy is subjective and honestly, I do not really like the term. Usually, there is something deeper going on. Few people just do not try when they have the tools, ability, and motivation to do what they need to do. Burn out happens when you have been going full steam ahead for a long period of time. This does not mean that you have been getting perfect grades and never doing anything wrong recently. This means that your mind and your body have not been able to sufficiently rest so that you can continue to put out your best effort. You have been treading water, pushing as hard as you can, and now you literally cannot keep going. Depression does have a clinical definition of symptoms but it is also an imbalance in your brain. You may be lacking dopamine or serotonin. Generally, you will feel unmotivated, sad, sleepy, unfocused and unsocial. You can try talking to a school counselor or therapist if you think you need outside help. Otherwise, maybe make a schedule with built-in breaks so you are not feeling so overwhelmed all the time."

I wish I had known what it was before because all those fears were so intense and real, but no one knew what was going on and just told me to \"relax, it is nothing\". It is so exhausting that if I could \"relax\" I would, but it is hard. First of all, you are able to identify your episode, which is a big step Your fears and thoughts may be delusional or nearly impossible. But your body's response is real. Stress activates your defense system, which includes the symptoms you wrote about. You may also feel like running or be unable to move. Here are some of my tips: -Grounding : this is the best trick for me. I talk out loud, tell what I see, where I am, tell some facts about what is going on around me. Sometimes I sing. But talking out loud helps me not to get too caught up in my head. It also helps me to get back to reality. You can also hold a stuffed toy. If you have someone, you can try to have a nice, light conversation about something you like. This person just needs to make sure to validate your distress and not diminish what you are feeling. They can also give you a hug, sometimes it feels good. Here is an article I found helpful for my boyfriend when I have panic attacks:  -Breathing techniques: I like the ones where I have to count the seconds, for example 3 seconds in and 3 seconds out. When you are ready, you can talk about what scares you and try to dissect where it comes from. I am 26 years old and I have been able to dissect and \"demystify\" some of my fears. I still have other fears that I need to face. But I am going at my own pace and I am functional even thought. You are really strong. It is okay to be afraid, I wish you know that you are normal and not alone. There is nothing wrong with you. Your body reacts to stress. And your body is working fine by responding to it. You will be ok. It might be difficult, it can take some times but I Am sure you will get it through  You deserve to heal Sending virtual hugs"

So in this situation they can and will tell your parents, but they cannot tell them general things or specifics about what is said in therapy (like if you say \"I hate my mom, she is a bitch, I am moving out the day i turn 18\" they cannot tell that information)."

Peoples brains are wired different from whatever the case is.

But there is no advice that will work for you if you do not want it to. Not saying that all your problems are fixed when you choose to be better, but the actions you do are choices you make, even if your thoughts are telling you different. This is the reality of mental health, and why these solutions will not work for everyone, but they can (and have) worked."

I was given a bed for a few hours and then discharged. I subsequently overdosed on meds and at the last hour had a Police Officer see me ODing who called an ambo. I went back to the same ED at St. Vincents and given a bed overnight, discharged the next morning. I walked around the Melbourne CBD for over 4 hours wearing just a hospital gown and in severe distress, just looking for a way to end it. Nobody intervened and I ended up again ODing on meds taken from a pharmacy. I was taken by ambulance to St. Vincents and had my stomach pumped plus given activated charcoal. I was discharged the following morning. I subsequently jumped in front of a tram and was again taken into custody by Police who were so frustrated they requested permission to take me to the Alfred rather than St. Vincents for the third time. Finally, at the Alfred I was given antipsychotics and held under the mental health act for 12 days. Discharged and I am OK now. The system does not work."

        "completion": "I hear and share your frustration. Nothing that I can say here will make you feel better about the current state of treatment options for mental health issues. But perhaps I can offer some perspective on our current level of understanding. This may give you some perspective and maybe a path forward. Perhaps not, but fuck it, here goes: I have studied neurons and brains for a living, for 30+ years now. And yet relative to what I perceive as the magnitude of the complexity of the brain, I know basically nothing. Fuck all, really. Studying the brain is a humbling enterprise, because very quickly you learn, despite 100+ years of modern research, we have barely scratched the surface. By analogy, if a grape represented what we know about the brain, what we do not know would be the size of a planet. Yes it does seem that other sciences (eg engineering of an iPhone) are light years ahead. But this is a fallacy. The truth is, our brains are light years more complex than an iPhone. The brain is so complex that we struggle to even grasp the magnitude of its compexity. Your brain has 100 billion neurons. We think now that it is the chemical and electrical changes at the connections or \"synapses\" between neurons where information is stored and \"computation\" (for lack of a better word ) happens, in concert with other synapses. We have about a quadrillion synapses (1 with 15 zeros after it) in our brains. Boggling. We think that your memories, your sense of self, your personality, are the result of the combined functioning of those quadrillion synapses. Unimaginably complex. The hard truth is the science of studying the brain is in its infancy. Like astronomy before the invention of the telescope or more accurately, the stone ages. My point: even with all the modern knowledge of the brain, we are still just fumbling around in the dark, because of how little we know. So yeah mental health issues are frustrating, because we know (relatively) fuck-all about the brain. HOWEVER, what we do know, through research studies and clinical trials, is that some drugs & therapies in different combinations make things better for some people. I know none of this will make you feel better about the current situation, but the hard truth is, fumbling about, trying different things that have been shown to work for others is all we have, here in the brain stone age. None of this is good news, but I am being straight with you in what I see as our current capabilities. Frustrating as hell, I know. I have struggled with treating my anxiety with different meds and multiple therapists for decades. I still struggle, a lot. But I feel better now than 10 years ago. So if you want to get better, you must try different things suggested by your doctor. Yes it is frustrating, but it is all we have right now. Be well, my friend. I hope you find a measure of happiness, my fellow stone age human."

For others that can provide a small amount of relief from the complexity of their issues. Mental health is so complex and really beyond our current understanding to completely cure it. The people that tell you these things do it with good intent. It is not their fault that they are unable to cure everyone with mental health issues. The system. Is far from perfect. We have had people sent back to us who clearly should have been admitted and was only when the person refused to come back to the site did medical step in more. I understand that while these things have not worked for you that there are many others that they do help. Even if it is just a bit. I wish I was cured of mine yet do not think it will be in this lifetime. I still see a counsellor and give myself a break and try to live my life the best I could.

You are also essentially telling others who may be looking into these approaches not to try even though it may actually work for them."

I tried edibles, loved them, and it became a great thing to look forward to on the weekends. I did not smoke because i found it to be messy, stinky, and not as easy to get. Today, nearly 2 years later, I still enjoy edibles, but after I started get sick of the taste, I finally started smoking joints. When I first started, I was cool only doing edibles on the weekends. Then I slowly started convicing myself that I could do it on weekdays because by the next morning, I would be fine. Then it became almost every night whenever I had them. Not because I felt like i needed to but because I wanted to. I worry that I will not know when I have crossed the line. You know how they say \"Crazy people do not know they are crazy\". Do people on the cusp of addiction know they are addicted...? The thing is for me, I do it simply because I like it, not because I feel a NEED to. I did not smoke tonight and I am fine. I planned to, but decided not to because I had shit to do. Is this how it starts? How will i know when/if its becoming something more? Honestly, I feel I could stop smoking and doing edibles right now and be fine, beyond the occassional boring weekend where i would want them.",

See, we cannot always see our path, but oftentimes others can see it for us. Isolating yourself is just about the worst thing you can. I suggest reaching out to whoever you can to give your life that little \\sparkle\\ again. Just find anything that gives you a modicum a joy, it does not have to be a lot. I know when depression hits, even your most favorite thing becomes mundane, but everyone has that one thing. That one thing that lights you up and you cannot stop talking about. For some, it is art or exercise. Mine? Legend of Zelda. We could sit down and I could tell you about the different arcs, theories, creepy tidbits- it goes on And it is not enough to just \"do\" what that one special thing. LIVE that one special thing Own it It is your special thing Talk to others about it (yes, even to a stranger in line at Wally World), join groups, forums, watch videos. BREATH IT. Stare at your Sephiroth Amiibo and allow yourself to daydream about his beautiful hair. It seems stupid, yes. But this is called redirection! Redirect these feelings into something good.

Specifically, I have told ChatGPT my inner most thoughts and fears only to be provided with absolute compassion, practical advice and an assurance of complete confidence, privacy and anonymity. Yes, I am still here today because of this AI technology that has also changed my professional life (I am a lawyer). What else? My ADHD meds (methylphenidate) consistently provide me with such an incredible dopamine boost each morning it is literally all I think about when I wake up. My mother has gone out of her way to support me by both flying me back home and letting me stay with her for 2x weeks. Then applied for emergency housing on my behalf resulting in me now being at a nice hotel for the foreseeable future, paid for by the Australian government. I am day 11 of severe opioid withdrawal after my private psychiatrist had his authority to prescribe controlled drugs revoked. This has supported my claim I have been prescribed substances in massive quantities without proper assessment and consideration. I have an upcoming court appearance that I am really looking forward to and feel absolutely prepared for. I am facing a serious criminal charge that has had life altering consequences and I am confident it will be thrown out and I will do everything I can to make the result public if I am successful. As a result of all the above, I have attained a sense of complete self-acceptance. I have severe Narcissistic Personality Disorder and have never been able to admit or accept this until now. I am learning about supply and how my actions are so socially destructive and reprehensible despite me having very genuine and sincere intentions. I am so lucky to live in Australia where the support I desperately need is not only available but provided to me free of charge. I am blessed to have a Mum who would be quite justified in leaving me alone, only to really demonstrate an intense love and desire to see me succeed in whatever that looks like for me. I am not working at the moment and have ceased all advice and representation services. I do not know if I will ever go back to being a legal advocate and will likely go into consulting in the future. My advice for others would be to sign up for ChatGPT and consider it a therapist. I think you will be genuinely surprised and happy at how effective it is to have something available that provides advice and support without judgement or even a professional fee. I am learning more about myself as I go through this difficult time of my life and I think learning about yourself is one of our core desires and motivations."

        "completion": "Hi friend I heard horror stories about being bulimic. I heard it even caused death. But I thought nothing of it when I started. I actually felt a genius. So instead of a horror story, one thing that helped me was the cold hard and objective facts of what is happening and what will happen. That way, you can decide if this is something you want to continue on with or try to curve now to avoid these things. Sorry this is long: After a while your body starts saving the fat like a kid with candy bars. So even if you throw up, your bodies digestive system will not work as fast. It will slow down your metabolism and go into shock. It will therefore become 10x harder to lose any weight now and in the future. This will condition your body to go into a sort of fight or flight mode, causing your body to think, \"oh shit, this is how life is - I better store all of the fat and nutrients that I can\" It is hard to regulate yourself after this. You will have to change almost everything in your life - eating 3 meals a day at the same time, eating nutrient dense meals, perhaps taking supplements to be a catalyst for reversing the damage and trauma done to your stomach. Without re-regulating your stomach, you will find it harder to lose weight indefinitely. You cannot just purge for x amount of time and go back to normal. You will have to find a way to balance out your hormones because purging does not just affect your weight and stomach, it affects your adrenal glands, your kidneys and your liver too which produce the hormones that your body uses to regulate emotions, bodily processes, how your skin reacts to stimuli, and basically how every organ and body system acts. If you do not curve it now, Your teeth will become raw due to loss of enamel. Your stomach contains acid and bile that inherently comes up whenever you purge and that causes your enamel to thin out which causes increased sensitivity. An example would be, your teeth will hurt while you are drinking cold water or eating ice cream. They will also hurt when you are just resting or brush your tongue against them. I am sure you are aware of the discoloration that can happen, but your stomach also contains a lot of bacteria. This bacteria is not bad, but necessary for your metabolic processes. It is meant for your stomach though, and will cause your breath(basically, it mixes with the bacteria in your mouth) to be funky. You will have to brush more often to get the smell to go away, even if it is not apparent to you, but brushing your teeth will also be a bit painful so you will have to be very careful of the toothpaste you use and what kind of toothbrush. You also should not expose your breath to anyone after you purge, but you cannot brush your teeth right away or use mouthwash after either. If you have your tonsils, then you are at risk for reoccurring strep throat and tonsillitis which is painful and contagious, so be weary of that. Taking antibiotics often and at a young age is not the business because your body can become resistant to them, causing you to feel pain longer. It will affect your hair due to your body not regularly getting the nutrients that it needs to sufficiently have homeostasis. As you get older, your hair will thin out quicker vs. those who do not purge. The mind is a tricky thing. It will most definitely because or worsen depression and anxiety, especially around weight, meals, socializing with others and it will distort your self worth. You are telling yourself that you will damage yourself to obtain a smaller figure because you are not worthy of love and happiness right now as you are, which is conducive to living a happy and healthy life where you feel self actualized. Your life can change once your perspective changes, and your life can and will increasingly get better when you focus on making healthy lifestyle choices for yourself. This is the opposite of that, so safe to say that your life will get worse. Not only will you struggle now, but also years to come. 5 years. 10 years. You will need professional help to regain a sense of confidence that is not based on body dysphoria and self harm. You might have to be honest with your friends, family and partners to a certain extent about this sickness - definitely partners. We are not as clever as we think and bulimia is common. It is obvious. You might only purge for 1 week now, but like any other drug, your tolerance will go up and your body will crave it and you will do it for longer stints. Last thing i am going to say, this is subjective Af: Going to the bathroom and making yourself throw up is hella nasty. Imagine yourself from a 3rd perspective, a fly on the wall perspective. It is sad. It is like a slow suicide. We all need help if we engage in bulimia. There are medications out there (such as Prozac, something I am on) that help fight depression and binge eating disorder/bulimia. Many professionals are trained to deal with this. People are forgiving and want to help, such as family and partners. Do not get in the way of yourself living a good life. You will feel extremely better about life if you exercise and eat healthy. Feed your body nourishment. Even exercise in your bed, just start today and have 0 days off. Even if you just do 1 push up or 5 sit ups. Try to eat a fruit every day. Do this for 75 days, call it a 75 days soft. Try to increase the exercise daily but do not stress yourself. You will see results fast and it also trains your body in a healthy way and changes your mindset. I also suffer from bulimia, but I am combatting it. If I told my younger self this, I hope I would have listened. Sending nothing but love"

They put so much feeling into things that, without emotion, would mean nothing. It puts everything into a clear black or white, right or wrong view.

Being a poor person with no health insurance in the US, I also could not justify the cost of preventative care. So I coasted by for years. Now that I have been in recovery for over a year, I am finding that the effects of my long-term bulimia are popping up en masse. My gums started bleeding today for no reason. My sex drive is wildly unpredictable and I continue to deal with body image issues. I also suspect I have ADHD (no diagnosis yet because again, no health insurance), which makes feeding myself regularly with the proper nutrition difficult. It is not blowing up my life like it did when I was actively bulimic, but it is impossible to ignore and impacts my quality of life on a daily basis. I know getting help is scary and might seem out of reach, but I wish I would taken my health more seriously at 19. You are valid and deserve attention."

Anyways, my point here is that doctors can tell you whatever, and its not as simple as that..... things can always be different. I assume you do not want to live your entire life as a bulimic, right? Which would mean at some point in your life you will have to recover, right? Also, the more damage you do - the more time you will need to repair, right?

        "completion": "Hi OP! I am currently in almost the same situation, and working on recovery by myself, as when my parents found out, they took my bathroom door, made me go to buffets and eat x amount of food, and so much more that hurt me in the long run. My advice to you is to start planning activities for after you eat. Maybe go on a walk with a friend or family member, go do a little shopping, or simply put yourself in a public place where it would be very difficult to purge unnoticed. I did this very slowly in the beginning, eating right before I had to leave for a class or meet up with someone, and over time, every time I ate, I was able to put myself in situations where I cannot, and the urge slowly went away. I quit checking the scale after that, which I understand you do not have a choice for right now, and I am so sorry. I found physical activities i loved. I adopted a dog, and told myself \u201cif I do not eat, I will not have the energy to take care of him in the way he deserves. I cannot afford to make my pet suffer because of my urge to be unhealthy\u201d. i chose to eat foods that would not give me the urge inside or need to purge. Like a spoonful of peanut butter as a snack or some of the yummy recipes like the green goddess salad. I buy my own food in my apartment and crossed out the nutrition labels so I could not read them anymore. I began heavily lifting and working out, which at first, scared me to death. I have since gained a LOT of muscle, and for the first time in my life, am truly happy with my body. My body is not skinny or slim. My body is not fat. My body is STRONG. I barely know any other women who can lift as much weight as I can, and the strict routine(with all the scheduling, exercise choices, allotting a timeframe/what I am going to do) gave me the control i wanted in my life that originally came from my bulimia. This is not to say I am fully recovered. I am not. I still do it sometimes if I am really stressed or had a bad day, and the feeling of not having the energy to do my other normal activities pales in comparison to the wonderful soreness I feel in my butt a day after hipthrusts. I like the soreness that I get after working out. It tells me I am achieving something similar to when my weight on the scale would decrease. It is a dual edged sword however, because I had to go from \u201cI am not pushing myself enough\u201d to \u201coh, I am really sore today and not feeling quite right. I guess I will have to have a rest day tomorrow\u201d. The best part of all my weightlifting and my new routine? I am in full control of my body. I can run for miles, lift double my body weight, wear flattering clothes, and look at myself in the mirror without crying(most of the time. I am not perfect and I have my days). The lifting began as a coping/control mechanism, but my thighs have become more tones and muscly, my butt has gotten bigger, my boobs are smaller, and my waist shrunk drastically, but I gained 20 pounds. I had to learn that my strenh was more important than my weight. I hope for the best for you. I hope you find a hobby or activity that gives you enough control to overcome this horrendous condition. I hope you become free from it is horrid shadowy claws, and you posting on here tells me that you are ready to fight and beat it."

The very thought of eating makes me feel sick and when I do feel hungry I would rather feel the hunger than actually eat. Even when I am not feeling worried or depressed I just do not enjoy eating food. I do not even like the smell of it. I take a daily prescribed medication that I believe suppresses my appetite even more but I have no choice but to take it. When I do force myself to eat I feel sluggish and lethargic, and sometimes sweaty and clammy afterwards. It is very uncomfortable which is another reason I avoid eating. However, not eating makes me feel weak and sick all of the time too. I would like to know if there is a name for this specific issue so I can start looking for resources to find information for help.

Hollywood and models play a role in body image but for a lot of people It can be frustrating when that is the only type of representation we get.

I switched symptoms from being restrictive to being a binge eater and always panicking I was not \u201ccurvy enough\u201d then the other side of my ED would kick in and I would panic and purge it all. It was a horrible cycle that almost killed me many times.

As much as i am sure he wants to be in your life the entire 15yrs he may feel ya been better off without him. I cannot say what hes honestly thinking of course but those are things that play through a lot of addicts heads and why we relapse and push people away. Addiction is brutal. There Is many days where dealing with life problems and my addiction i have asked god to take me. There Is been a lot of advancement in the field from the medical community, the laws are getting better at helping people and so is the public on accepting addicts but we as in the US have had really bad methods of dealing with drugs and addiction for a really long time a lot of the bs is engrained in people so they just keep trying to be harder on drugs! Sure its worked so well we just get harder and well have this drug war won. Sarcasm... If ya want to see him and see him stay sober id let him know its ok he relapsed. That ya are not disappointed and ya would like to still see him and you would like to be involved in his recovery if he would allow it. Of course that is all up to you and what ya think is best for you. You are more important than your dad. Ya have to look at for you first and foremost and i am sure he would tell ya the same."

After a 30s rinse, spit it out, floss, then brush, scrape your tongue of bad breath bacteria and finish with a mouthwash. DO NOT use any teeth whitening products (ie whitening strips) as your enamel is already damaged from past vomiting. Speak to a dentist if you have any concerns. Best of luck!"

(Sorry if this is unsolicited, I am assuming the help at the end of your post was a genuine request, ill remove if not.) I have not quite figured out this situation, but I was able to break the cycle a couple weeks ago. First, I realized that I was using b/p to stall facing an immense fear of applying for a program. I had to face that underlying fear in order to even come close to breaking the cycle. My therapist had me write down everything I was scared of happening, and sit facing those fears for a while before writing positive outcomes (this helped me a lot). Then, I planned 15 minutes in my day to work on my application and (here is the part that was crucial to me) I HAD TO AVOID TRIGGERS AT ALL COST. Planning was not enough, I still b/p'ed. I literally took $20 in cash to a coffee shop with me, had an accountability buddy check on me when I got there, etc. It was extreme, but I REALLY had to work on this. Everyone is triggers are different, so you may choose different things, mine is being at home. Finding the courage and discipline to do this is hard, but I took 5 minutes in a neutral zone (i was at work) to plan this all out. Setting timers makes things feel more approachable to me (15 mins to start, 5 mins to plan, etc). You can alwaus do more time, too. I am not like \"cured\", i definitely fell off the wagon and stopped working on it. But, your post inspired me reface what worked for me last time, and to start again.

I know that is really scary and also it can feel really terrible after eating as well or you can feel guilty.

I always get flustered and forget things or minimize my issues when I get there. Having a list in front of you will help you stay on track. Second - you can tell them in the beginning you think it is a problem with your heart and ask them to investigate that. You can request bloodwork and lab work to be done. If I have specific concerns before the appointment, I usually bring it up when I am checking in. IF they dismiss your concern and attribute it to weight, you can ask them to write that in the notes. They should document that you think it is a heart problem, they did not investigate, and they think it is your weight. This will usually prompt them to investigate further. If it does not push them to investigate further, ask them if they have a recommendation for a doctor that has experience listening to the patient (this is probably snippy so feel free to re-word as you wish)"

Think forward ten, twenty, fifty years and consider how an easy hip fracture can land you in the hospital and further complications can put you in an assisted living and take away your independence. Getting my period back was my one and only motivator for recovering. I want longevity- bone health is SO important for this. Consider reading No Period Now What by Dr. Nicola Rinaldi!

And now that those things are gone, you have nothing left but to sit with those uncomfortable feelings and deal with them head on. My advice would be to try and be mindful of when these things come up, sit with them, and let them pass on without judgement. Sometimes those icky feelings are inviting us to make a change in our life, and sometimes they are just irrational or trauma responses. By noticing when they come up, you can better figure out where they are coming from. I find mindfulness meditation and exercising to be a good channel for this sort of thing. Good luck!"

Therapy had never helped and I could not afford it anyway. So I was on my own for the most part. I watched a lot of YouTube recovery channels and that was incredibly helpful in the beginning. I also began with a keto - style diet, not to lose weight, but to help with my extreme hunger. (I did not lose any weight) The higher fat intake was incredibly helpful with regulating my appetite and blood sugar along with lots of salad and probiotic foods like yogurt. Again, not for losing weight, but for health and eventually incorporated more carbs when I realized my appetite was under control. I am not saying this is what everyone should do, it was just how i did it to begin with. I had to force myself to eat enough and get actual nutrition and it was not exactly linear, i think if i had a therapist I may have moved forward more quickly. I still have digestive issues to this day, and bad body image days but it is so worth being free of this living hell.

It is hard to define what changed - I hit rock bottom, really, but why that was rock bottom and nothing else had been, I do not know. My eating disorder had gotten so bad mentally that i could not get literally a moments break from it, and that type of life was exhausting and painful and I did not want to imagine living the rest of my life like that. I had started to vaguely hope that recovery was possible, and eventually thought trying for that had to be better than giving into living the rest of my life as I was.

It does not mean that we are not sensitive. It does not mean that we will not make the best friend someone ever had. None of it.

For me, I just feel like I am too fucked up to ever be with someone. I just do not think the man for me exists. But in no way should you ever feel like you do not have really fucking amazing things to offer just because you have personal issues. People who say that you have to love yourself before you can love anyone else, are really just ableists who lack the ability to empathize. They are also wrong. I was going to post some links but I figured maybe instead I could suggest to you to search online this subject. Psychology Today has a few articles that I found. If I can find this one source that I think is kind of perfect, I will share. I just have to find it. I remember when I read it, It really spoke to me because I used to think that I had to love myself first. But I only thought that because that is the BS I heard when I was much younger.

I remember when i was at a new job once, after a few weeks, i overheard my boss asking a staff member who was on the shop floor with me that day how I was getting along. I was terrified, because I felt like I was always asking questions and forgetting things (and this staff member was particularly bitchy.)

That sadness that seems to come from within your chest and then wrap itself around you until you become cocooned inside it. You do not want to move, eat, go anywhere, do anything, see anyone. Lay in bed for days. Leave dishes everywhere, stay in the same clothes for days, do not answer your phone. Let your plants die, pile up dirty clothes. It sucks. But it is warm and comforting like a nostalgia from years ago, like a weighted blanket you cannot keep off of you. I used to have these kinds of episodes. On smaller scales, not super long periods of time, but I was dealing with this. Since then I have spend each and every day just clawing my way out of that blanket; forcing open the cocoon. Fight to keep myself functional, as a productive human being. I cannot afford to go into a depression like this. I have a job, a life. But damnit if I am not inclined to take a week or 2 off of work so I can fall into this again. Depression sucks. Do not get me wrong. I hate being in the middle of a delicious meal and then getting hit with a pang of deep sadness so strong that I have absolutely zero appetite and have to throw that great food away. At my worst I did not eat for days. I tried to claw myself from that blanket and I just could not. That strenh of fight I need to keep myself afloat just was not there. I would make myself bowls of top ramen just to take 2 bites of it, almost vomit, and pour it out. These episodes really suck. But they are almost addictive.

I turn off my phone. I numb myself, or cry or whatever comes up with my emotions that day, and I give into that old coping mechanism. I Am learning to do this without judgement.

Definitely bring this up with your therapist, perhaps they will be able to help that initial trigger, but regardless bringing up any trigger is only going to help you and your therapist work on a treatment plan.

        "completion": "Coping mechanism: noise cancelling headphones / soft music. Recovery steps: Listening to videos of people shouting on youtube first on low volume, so it does not scare you, then gradually increasing the volume by 5% each time. Watch the same videos so your mind is used to content and there are no surprises. Just increase the volume by 5% once every few days. Your mind will be able to separate out volume from content. While doing this emphasize in your mind that the youtube video will never jump out of the monitor to attack you and therefore it is not a danger. The more your mind associates \"loud sounds\" with \"no danger\", the faster your recovery. Good luck! PS: Screaming / shouting is a big trigger for me and doing this helped me to an extent. It helps to ask yourself every time you hear a loud sound: > Is this actually a danger to my life? If not, then it is just a discomfort. Discomfort is not danger."

It does not even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student\u2019s name while I am doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone is not even angry. Or a few weeks ago when a classmate was not wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. My sibling who is 12 can be described as a \u2018troublemaker\u2019 I guess. They are the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents\u2019 nerves. They do not listen, are not okay with being told \u201cno\u201d and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I have heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I would be in the same room, other times I would be in my room and they would be downstairs. During these times I will also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I am in the same room I will not even say a word and just get up and leave because it is too much. I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really do not understand why this happens to me Thank you in advance for the help :)",

It still happens now that I am back home from college due to the pandemic. My anxiety levels remain through the roofs when they yell. It is the most terribly heartbreaking thing to observe and hear. When someone yells, sometimes I have to yell back in order for them to just stop. So yes, I can definitely relate with you. I mostly listen to music to drown all of that out because it is not always in my control to stop someone else from yelling especially when they get upset with my involvement. I also like to take a deep breath and then stop and then exhale very slowly to stop my heart from racing too much. Breathing exercises definitely help!"

I had been addicted to World of Warcraft in 2008/2009 so as you can imagine I was quite good at the game. I went cold turkey when I started going to college in the fall of 2009 and I recovered. But I always thought of myself as good at that game. I took pride in it. A few years later (2018 or so) I went to an Internet cafe, downloaded the game and fired it up. I quickly realized though that I was not only no longer good at the game but I simply had no idea how to move my character; one of the most basic parts of the game. It shattered my word view and caused some kind of existential dread. I sat there in disbelief soaking it up but left without doing anything more. Similarly, I grew up bipolar and my psyche was scarred with the knowledge that I was a danger to myself and to others with my emotional issues and mania. It was not until I met my now ex in 2018 that she helped me repair my self image of myself by loving me unconditionally and helping me unravel that negative self image. But I never had that \u201cmoment\u201d where it all clicked. But, what is it like to realize.... \u201cpeople view me as X and I had no idea\u201d? Was it an incident? A destiny with drugs?

        "completion": "Do it. Take a break from the digital world and people. Trying something radically different like that can be very refreshing for this kind of trudging through a rut mindset. The important part is to have a goal or a few going into it. What are you going to do instead? Pick up a book instead of your phone? What if you limit digital things instead of cold turkey go without? That way you can devote time to trying new games or something. Take an online class that allows you to go at your own pace w/ limited interaction. Start a blog or journal about your experience on this journey. Tell your friends you will be unavailable for x amount of time and you look forward to returning refreshed. Start handwritten pen pal letters with some friends and express that you want to feel more connected in the real world. It is not hopeless, it is not the sims, it is just how the internet unfortunately developed. It was once more open and free and expressive, and now it is about mass media manipulation and installing maladaptive behavioral changes. If you have not seen 'The Social Dilemma' on Netflix, make sure you check that out. It is hard to unlearn and undo maladaptive behaviors and coping skills but definitely possible Looking into behavioral therapy models like CBT, DBT, REBT might give you specific tools to unlearn some of these behaviors and automatic thoughts. I totally understand where you are coming from and recently disconnected from all social media besides Reddit myself. It is hard and I find myself staring at nothing and just zoned out a lot. As soon as I become aware that is happening, I remind myself it takes work and effort to replace the emptiness and it is okay if it takes time to build up other habits and hobbies. Just do the next right thing. And I usually get distracted again and repeat. It is getting better. I feel better even though I am struggling because I know I am building better habits. Baby steps"

So you project this new experience as something you should do and your usual habits as something you should not. Try and reframe your thinking and tell yourself that it is OK to go on Reddit - but it is also OK if you do not want to. And it is OK to not want to read a new book, but it also could be really fulfilling (as it often is). Once you train this muscle by actually following through with new activities, it will become like second nature.

I obviously cannot know your exact situation, but considering you have PTSD I am assuming you are a victim of some form of past trauma. Trauma survivors have an extremely strong tendency to disconnect from, forget, or deny the severity of what they have been through and how it impacted them. I obviously cannot say this is 100% what you are going through, but it could be a factor. But it could also be that society really still does not take mental health seriously enough. There is still many people with the \"get over it\" or \"just do this, just do that\" mindset. This does not help. Not to mention the entire \"this is just for attention!\" mindset people have as well. (A rant I will save for another day.) From one struggling person to another, you are almost certainly not faking it. Everything you feel is valid, and part of healing is accepting how you are and how you feel right now.

        "completion": "Oh dear friend, this is totally natural and normal. Without going into great detail, this has been a very difficult year for me. I have had to come to terms with childhood trauma that I have been repressing, recognize how it affects me in my daily life, all while having my family apparently Fall apart. I say all that to say this, I have never had thoughts of suicide but what you are expressing here I have basically felt all year. Maybe if I got hurt at work, or in a car accident, something that is not my fault. similar to you, I have no plans, I do think life is important, and furthermore I think your life is important. Obviously I do not know your entire story and situation but I know for me it is simply because the pain that I have experienced this year is too much! Here is what I mean. ( Allow me to share what I have been learning in therapy) When we do not know how to process difficult emotions, they essentially get stuck inside of our nervous system. Pretty much all of us do not know how to process difficult emotions, and it does not matter how old they are, 10 minutes, 10 days, 10 years, and the more we move on in life without processing them, the more they weigh down on us. Keep in mind that most of this is subconscious, normally are awareness of how affected we are emotionally, mentally and physically is very small, and we do not know how all of those things work together. When we carry these difficult emotions without processing them it actually triggers survival instincts inside of our body. Essentially we experience a difficult emotion, are nervous system thinks that we are in danger, and that triggers a response. Most of us know these responses as fight or flight, but there is actually way more. There is also faint, freeze, flock I have learned to understand that when my mind becomes overwhelmed, and my emotions are overwhelmed, my body responds instinctually and basically prepares itself for death. In severe cases, your different body systems will even completely shut down if the threat is too much for you to handle. What I have learned is to recognize this instinct, do not over identify it, maybe I do not want to die or have a horrible accident Maybe I am way too overwhelmed and I have not take the time to process those thoughts and those feelings. For me it has been helpful to think of my mind, my emotions, and my body as a team. I am learning through therapy to get all of them talking together so that I can make better decisions that are healthy and safe. This may sound silly but if you have ever seen the Pixar movie Inside Out, it is like when all of the characters that represents the different emotions are fighting over control of the person that they inhabit rather than working together. Again, I do not know your story, but I totally understand the feeling, I totally understand where that response comes from inside of our brain and body systems. Friend, I hope that you can find the support and help you need to dive into your emotions and thoughts. To give them the space they need to process so that your whole system, your mind, your emotions and your body can finally rest."

So I do not really have people telling me \"oh you used to be bubbly, what happened to you now\" So figuring which of my feelings and thoughts are symptoms of depression or disassociation or anxiety and which of them are just my normal emotions is difficult. Which is problematic because I Am working on fixing my irrational responses, but how can I do that if I cannot figure out which ones are irrational? If I feel irritated at someone is that just how I am or is it like repressed feelings boiling up? Am i truly an introvert who enjoys solitude or am I actively withdrawing because I am afraid of being hurt? I have had lukewarm success in dealing with this.

Specifically those who started going through mental health struggles at a younger age, as well as those went through any form of depersonalization I am thankfully going through recovery after many months of depression and depersonalization . A choppy recovery with many ups and downs but recovery nonetheless. However its like I Have been sick for so long I do not really know what my original personality was like. It does not help that all the people i know now I Have met while I was deep in the depressive episode, so everyone knows me as a quiet guy who likes to self isolate. So I do not really have people telling me \"oh you used to be bubbly, what happened to you now\" So figuring which of my feelings and thoughts are symptoms of depression or disassociation or anxiety and which of them are just my normal emotions is difficult. Which is problematic because I Am working on fixing my irrational responses, but how can I do that if I cannot figure out which ones are irrational? If I feel irritated at someone is that just how I am or is it like repressed feelings boiling up? Am i truly an introvert who enjoys solitude or am I actively withdrawing because I am afraid of being hurt? I have had lukewarm success in dealing with this. Usually I just follow mt gut intuition that tells me, \"this is not you, you shoudnt be feeling this way\" I have several other meditation type techniques that help me with this.

I have spent months at a time (a year or so back) frantic that I \"lost my personality\". I remember writing in a journal in worry that I genuinely believed my next best move was to reiterate each element of my personality back one thing at time... whatever that meant. Anyways -- fast forward 1.5 years and I am seeing the detrimental effect that added worry about \"who I am\" has had. Those anxious thoughts around it always felt so negative and daunting and flat out terrifying. I have (with time) given myself some grace in that its really okay to not feel super developed into myself, and that, as much as it sucks, time reveals. The ability to be slightly more lighthearted with it has reduced some of the worry and fear, which in a roundabout way allows me to feel more connected to myself. \"Am i truly an introvert who enjoys solitude or am I actively withdrawing because I am afraid of being hurt?\" FELT."

I feel like the word friend is just something you say now. I feel like it is the same level as acquaintance. Almost like when people say hey how are you. They really do not care.

We had financial issues in the past and my mom was always talking about how expensive medication was, how we could not afford it, you get it. In my situation, medication was necessary as well as therapy. I was also institutionalized three times. And ever since then i have been going to therapy and taking meds which really helped! But i feel like I do not deserve it. Maybe not \"deserve\", but I feel like I am not worthy of getting better. I am currently doing a project for my health class. One of the things I have to do is analyze the cost of health services - ambulance rides, emergency room costs, other things along those lines. The more I research and discover how expensive these things actually /are/, the more guilt I feel. I feel terrible. Not only did I traumatize my family, but I also costed them a LOT of money. I am a fucking shitty person and I wish there was a way to stop existing without causing my family any pain. I am a huge burden, both financially and emotionally. My mom is always saying she is happy I am getting better, but I know from the hushed whispers from her conversations with her husband that I am actually just draining their pocket. She does not deserve the amount of stress I am putting her through. I am the one that tried to kill themselves. It was my fault. Their money should be going to something better.

You did not choose to be sick anymore than a diabetic chooses to have an insulin crisis or an epileptic chooses to have a seizure. See how ridiculous it sounds talking about those things? Yet, we blame ourselves for mental health issues. It is good you are getting help. I have been in and out of the hospital and treatment programs a lot in the last 5 years due to my bipolar. It is been easily over $20k out of pocket for my bills and treatments. My husband points out that he would rather I get better than lose me and to not feel bad about the medical bills. Try to focus on getting better, beating yourself up about things you cannot control will not help you feel better. Be kind to yourself, you had a crisis and you got the help you needed. I have survived several suicide attempts and I have always felt so badly after for putting my family through that but I was not in my right mind. Now I know when I need more help. Make a crisis plan and ask for help before you get to the stage of suicide. Do not hold off because you are afraid of bills. Your parents would take bills any day over losing you.

Or I accidentally stole something at work and have not noticed yet, but I am going to get fired and arrested because I work in a pharmacy and I will be laying here and suddenly convince myself I brought home a bunch of Adderall or Percocet or god knows what. How would that happen exactly? It would not, because that does not even make sense. But I am anxious. Or I panic my LDR boyfriend is cheating on me at that very moment, even if a) I just got off of Facetime with him like 5 minutes prior b) I have absolutely no reason to believe this is true. He is a great guy, he is never acted suspicious or weird, and I really do trust him. We have been together for over 2 years and not once have I ever questioned his loyalty\u2026 but it is something about closing my eyes at night that brings out anxiety that is not based in reality. Sleep used to be such a relief from my anxious brain, but I feel like it is being stolen from me. The worst part is I have actual things I could worry about (bills, politics, school) but when nighttime hits the only thing my brain wants to do is get incredibly anxious over non-existent theft, an imaginary ax murderer, and a relationship problem that purely exists in my stupid mean anxious brain. Sigh.",

I would worry about the most ridiculous things, and even though I knew these things were very unlikely to happen, I still worried.

I went through a really stressful event a few months ago which made my anxiety skyrocket. I have been suffering from chest pains that come and go but sometimes can last all day. It feels like a deep pain or intense burning on the left side of my chest. I have been to numerous doctors appointments and have had ECGs, a heart echo, CBC blood test, and comprehensive metabolic panel. The doctor told me there was nothing wrong with my heart and that she would be shocked if a healthy 28 year old was having a heart attack. I am still convinced that somehow the doctor missed something. When I am in the midst of intense chest pain, it is hard to not want to go to the ER, but I cannot afford to go to the ER every time the chest pain happens since it is so frequent. I would probably be there once a week. I am at a point where I am constantly anxious due to the chest pain which then is probably making the chest pain worse. And sometimes the pain comes up even when I am not feeling particularly anxious, which then makes me anxious. It is a never ending cycle. How can I convince myself that I am not having a heart attack? Is it dangerous to just ignore chest pain and assume it is anxiety? Now that I have had all the tests I question whether my health has changed since having them, even though they were all last month. Are there any other tests I should request to rule out a health problem? Help",

Turns out i am an incredibly healthy 23 year old who just has extreme anxiety. I have horrible health anxiety as well any weird symptom gets me googling and spirals me out of control. It really is just anxiety, which manifests in horrible ways. Sometimes my face gets numb and i get brain fog and it gets me so worried. Anxiety is like a bully the more attention you give it the more it torments you. Try breathing techniques and meditation. Breathing has really helped me get some form of control over my body. What helped me the most is exercise. Running or just walking around your neighborhood is a great form to relieve stress and anxiety. Distractions and hobbies will be your best friend. Its okay Anxiety sucks but worrying about it and causing more stress will only make it worse. Chest pain is a normal symptom of anxiety."

Also, just knowing that I will be allowing myself to eat again was a huge realization and made me feel much less restricted. Another thing that I think helped a lot is building up other aspects of my life to help satisfy me. When I was deeply stuck in my bulimia cycle, I pretty much isolated from all of my friends and family. Now I basically force myself to spend time with others, which decreases my binge urges because I feel like my life overall is much more fulfilling. I also spend more time actually doing things I enjoy. I know this probably will not change much but I hope it at least helps a little! :)"

Then have a distraction planned after eating like playing a game, doing a puzzle, talking to a friend, reading, going for a walk, listen to music etc. Distraction can be really helpful when we are dealing with heightened anxiety after eating. Finally, set an intention around this food. You can say something to yourself like, \"My intention is to eat this bar and not purge.\" or \"I can trust myself around this food.\" Imagine exactly how you want your interaction with this food to play out.

        "completion": "Oh I am so sorry you had this experience it sounds like it was dreadful. If you can find a dietitian who specialises in eating disorders they can be absolute gold. I have an AMAZING dietitian who I really trust and who keeps me wanting to pursue recovery even though I am struggling. What makes this dietitian so great is that she explains the science behind why we need to eat and what our bodies do with the nutrients and how bulimia affects our bodies. She also counsels me around my behaviours and we look at strategies for managing them. Lastly, she prescribes me a meal plan but we work together to make it with foods I like eating so that it works for me and my lifestyle. I think getting a good psychologist as well can be really helpful too. The dietitian will counsel you but they cannot do what a therapist can in terms of looking at deep seated emotional issues and ways of thinking, doing and being. I would also recommend finding a good GP who can look after the medical side of things and co-ordinate your care between providers. Good luck with your journey, I hope you can build a great team around you to support your recovery."

It is SO hard to find treatment for bulimia/BP, probably because even treatment for AN-R fucking sucks and just focuses on \u201clet us make you eat a ton and gain weight\u201d so when you take out that part there is not much left that they know how to actually do\u2026 I have had a great experience with my current dietician, she is not judgmental and really works with me on what I need to work on (not what she thinks I need). She gives me advice on nutrition for ED, as well as helping me with B/P, chronic digestive issues and managing a special diet. You got to make sure to find one who is specifically an ED dietician though, the other ones do not know jack shit about EDs and might say harmful stuff. You should definitely look into a psychologist too. Nothing has been more helpful for me B/P wise than going into therapy to assess why I have b/p urges, what triggers them, what are the underlying issues. I wish you all the best with your recovery - seeking help is definitely the hardest step (at least in many cases). That experience must have been so discouraging but please do not take it as a sign that you should not/cannot recover. You can do this."

It is hard not to feel like I was so high-achieving in high school and that all came crashing down as soon as I graduated and moved out. But a) I have a lot more responsibilities now so it is an unfair comparison, and b) deadlines imposed by other people (such as homework being due x day or your parents making you do the dishes after dinner) are much easier to meet than self-imposed deadlines or goals.

Now, a few years later, I basically watch TV and surf the web. Some days I do not leave the house at all or speak to anyone. I tried therapy, but the TALK therapist tried to steer me toward SSRIs, which I refuse to take. I know I need to drastically change my life (relocate, primarily, to where I could build a life), but I am lucky to get the dishes done or a shower taken. Paralyzed."

I suggest at least going to therapy to figure things out. And maybe a psychiatrist too. Meds changed my life for the better and I am back to being a high achiever. Leaving the workplace temporarily on legal sick leave vetted by psychiatrists was also helpful. When you are on, you are on. I would rather just leave temporarily to figure things out, than doing a bad job and ruin my reputation. The same goes for studying.

It sounds like you are weakening the \"valve\" that keeps stuff in your stomach, which happens when the gag reflex is over-used (ie very common for people with bulimia). That allows acid to come back up, and can lead to \"involuntary regurgitation\" (throwing up \"in your mouth all day\").

Drink something with electrolytes. Eat soft foods, or nutritionally dense, easy to digest meals. (Soups are my friend when I am particularly spent, miso soup especially.) Drink water. Drink tea.

I guess I am just scared of gaining so much weight so fast cus i do not know how to control the bingeing and after restricting for so long it is like I am trying to make up for the last 4 months.

It was at its worst in 2018 right before I finished highschool. I developed heart palpitations and had to see doctors because of severe hip pain; they thought I had osteoporosis, luckily I did not, but that was a wake up call for me. I made myself go inpatient in 2019, miraculously got pregnant after getting out and gained more than double my weight after that. I ate because I was so scared my body could not keep up with being pregnant. Then I ate and ate because I was emotionally overwhelmed and had a baby. Now I am at my highest weight ever, active, but I keep overeating and I feel stuck in this loop. Whenever I try to lose weight i swing into anorexic habits. I have tried just focusing on being healthy and active which helps with depression but I can not stop emotional eating when I am anxious. And i am anxious 90% of the time. I hate my body so much and am having a hard time existing. I am seeing 3 therapists, but I am scared of talking about food issues as it holds a lot of shame.

What you are going through is normal for the condition you have got and your therapist will likely have the tools to help you manage it. Just remember, yes its scary coming back to this place, but you are not the same person you were years ago. You are so much better equipped to deal with what is going on, and I can say that definitively without even knowing you because you have already recovered once. If you have already recovered once, you can do it again. Do not get it into your head that your recovery was not real, because it was. I second mblca's advice from below, but I also understand where you are coming from about therapy. When I lapsed years ago (it was a bad lapse though, I was on the verge of recovery) I did not want to return to therapy or my protective strategies because they represented a time for me that I wanted to leave in the past. But I am glad I did, because it was a stepping stone to me being recovered as I write this. One day, I know I will probably relapse too.

I struggled with my eating disorder for a long time but have been recovered for quite a few years now, and one of the results of my disorder was the loss of my period. If you lose your period for three or more cycles/months, you should look into , which is what I dealt with. Essentially your body is trying to take care of you by predicting a loss of nourishment when you begin disordered cycles again, and begins to take the energy it uses for non urgent functions like preparing for a baby and uses that energy toward preserving and protecting your vital organs like your heart and brain. It is kind of cool :) That is how my doctor explained it to me, i am so sorry if i make no sense lol. Basically your body goes into battery saving mode \ud83d\ude2d I lost my period altogether from around ages 15-18. I am 22 now, and have had my regular cycle with no interruptions again for about 2 years now. Your body is amazing and will always do its best to take care of you, and you will be okay with recovery :) but I would definitely recommend bringing it up with your doctor for advice and to monitor it, and with your therapist for emotional support and reassurance. You are not alone this is very common with eating disorders but your body is trying to tell you something I know how hard and painful it is to struggle with this horrible disorder and I do not know if this helps, but I have gone through recovery and can confidently say I am so much happier now than I was when I was in my ED world. That little bitch voice in your head will tell you it is not worth it to recover, but it so is. One day, numbers will mean nothing to you and you will be happy, it is possible and you deserve it \u2665\ufe0f I hope this helps :)"

        "completion": "If you want to stop, you have come to the right place. This is a pro-recovery r/ after all. These are tips for reassessing your relationship with food, and putting some things into context. That said, let us put the behaviors into perspective: your body is starving. Starving is not just physical, it is mental and psychological. When people restrict, the body goes into survival mode, it conserves resources, it clings to any and all nutrition it gets because it believes that it will never see food again. Onto the mental side, your brain is also an organ that is starving. The \u201cdesperation\u201d and lack of control come from intense hunger. The body knows what it needs. I am not going to comment on the numbers revolving around your weight, but 6 months of starvation would inevitably lead to the brain psychologically changing and altering in order to try and save itself. I used to restrict all day and end up \u201cbinging\u201d at night. That was my body screaming for help. That was my brain begging me for nourishment. For fuel. The most difficult step towards recovery I took was realizing I could not trust myself to do it alone. I could not trust my altered brain chemistry, my eating disorder, to allow me to recovery. I sought professional help, but I know how difficult it is to actually\u2026 do that. Let us talk small steps. No particular order, just general tips to harm reduce and start the path to recovery. These are not \u201ctips to lose weight.\u201d This is about restoring a healthy relationship with food. - Eat something consistently. Utter restriction leads to compensation, start just eating something every couple of hours. Not just one big meal, not just nothing. Something consistently. You can worry about full nutrition later. Just eat something. - Meals with friends. Company I find makes mealtime easier. I am more inclined to enjoy the food- to make a positive experience and connection with food- if I am eating with people. You deserve positivity. Eating somewhere with a friend or a loved one makes a world of a difference. - Separate your thinking as your Eating Disorder. This is a simple way of thinking that can help shift perspective. Look, you have got this ED on your back running the show. Separating the you from the behaviors and relationship with food, even the negative comments on your body as your Eating Disorder trying to take you over\u2026 I do not know. It helped me a lot. - Write down things you want to do- you need a body to get you there. You need to nourish that body to do it. Sometimes deep in my ED its hard for me to know what I want to do, but if I want to walk around, write my novel, dive into my hobbies- I cannot do that starved and weak, clinging to my ED. I find it a helpful reframe in my priorities. - Stop counting calories. Is it easy to? No. I do not live in the US currently so the nutrition labels are a lot more discrete. Back home I would slap a post it over them. This takes time, I still try to roughly estimate in my head- but it is better than full on counting. - Throw out your scale. This is big- but man. I have no idea what I weigh. It is awesome. I do not have tips for this, I simply moved somewhere without a scale, but it made a world of a difference. - Reach out to others, which you have done! I think that is pretty damn cool, it shows that a part of you separate from your ED wants out. Life does not have to be like this, friend. - Think about seeking professional help (if you are able to.) Any support is better than none. There are free support groups online available, you do not even have to participate, you just have to show up. It makes a difference hearing other people\u2019s stories. This is not a comprehensive list, but it is a start. I am so glad you reached out. I am glad you are here. I cannot take private messages for my own health and safety, but know I am cheering you on and I am so proud of you for being here today."

It can even happen when evacuating bowels for those who are predisposed. ) I am being pedantic because some people will think this means they can pass out while driving from a panic attack.

Try using a little of kiddie toothpaste to your regular toothpaste for a sweet flavour. 2. Play a favorite song while you brush your teeth. 3. Purchase fun soaps and shampoos for the shower. 4.

        "completion": "I have Autism and ADHD and i have this same issue 1. Get a fun toothbrush, a stupidly funny one if you must. When i was 11 i got one of those singing electric ones and it was one direction themed. I brushed my teeth like 2 or 3 times a day while i had it just because i wanted to. 2. Find a toothpaste that you like and that you are comfortable with or can get comfortable with. Mint toothpaste used to really bother me and i did not even know how much it was bothering me until i switched but it made it really hard to brush my teeth when the only toothpaste i had was minty. 3. Work it into your schedule. I like to have a morning and bedtime routine. If brushing my teeth is part of my routine, I cannot skip it or else I will go crazy. A lot of the times it is more exhausting to get up to go brush my teeth than it is to actually do the brushing, so if i schedule it for when I am already up, I am more likely to actually do it. 4. If you are planning on having a bedtime snack, you do not have to wait until after the snack to brush your teeth. Obviously it is better to go to sleep with clean teeth than not clean teeth, but putting it off can make it so much harder to do it at all, and if i put it off it usually does not get done or i stay up for hours trying to get myself to do it. If you are the same way then it is better to brush your teeth when you normally do, even if you are planning on having a snack afterwards. 5. Get a sticker chart. I do not care if it is childish it fucking works. Basic self-care tasks can be really difficult because they can get so mundane, and giving yourself praise and recognition for taking care of your body makes you so much more inclined to do it again."

        "completion": "I am not diagnosed with anything other people on here are mentioning, but this is hard for me too. I think for me the struggle has always been, if I were doing it for someone else it would feel easy, but since it is for myself and no one else is going to hold me accountable or care, I have a hard time motivating myself. It just sometimes feels like a lot, and not because I am depressed. I think for me it has everything to do with my codependency and lack of care for myself. My concerns tend to be about other people. Even this post kind of screams why do I have to do this when I could be doing things for other people. I Do Not Know if I am just reading into that, but for me what is helped with that is learning to enjoy my time alone. I am extremely uncomfortable alone and have learned to connect with myself more authentically and more often due to my codependency work. I Do Not Know if any of this applies and if I am way off base please let me know, but I too brush my teeth as much as I can which is still sometimes once a day. I do not shower when I do not have to most times, but if I am feeling comfortable with myself, I do not mind doing it as much. Hoping you find a solution or at least feel less alone through this post."

I do not know for sure, but if anything I hope it is as peaceful as being under anesthesia. Plus we all die someday at some point. So if I do not go now it is not like I will not later on. Perhaps the one thing that currently keeps me going more than anything is being out in nature, experiencing the natural world as it was meant to be. When I walk through a forest I am easily captivated by the sheer amount of life there, and soak in as much of the sights and sounds as possible. But I am most at peace when I am by the ocean, or any large body of water, watching the waves roll by. The way the sun sparkles on its surface and the gentle breeze hits my skin reminds me that there is some beauty to being alive. If only for a moment, I can forget about living under the chokehold of capitalism and the daily pressures that come with it, and just Be.

Here are a few things I have learned: If I have been undereating, my stomach looses \"stretchiness\". I do not know exactly what is going on, but there is definitely a vicious cycle involved. When recovering from a relapse, it is not unusual for me to need to start with smaller more frequent meals, and work my way up to larger less frequent meals. I have also found it helpful to make sure I am eating plenty of natural flavorful fats - not so much bland fats like canola oil. No restrictions on saturated fat or cholesterol, I feel worse if I rely too heavy on \"healthy\" unsaturated fats like olive oil, even though I think olive oil is great and use it occasionally. When I eat plenty of natural flavorful fats like fatty meats and fish, butter, coconut milk, avocado, etc, it literally lubricates the food and makes it go down easier, it makes the food more satiating in a way the motivates me to eat more - but never motivates me to eat beyond what is physically comfortable. The food tastes better, it sits better in my stomach, I am satiated longer, and fat is calorically dense. A lot of people with EDs are scared of fats, especially saturated fats, and animal fats. If that is you, I would encourage you to challenge your fears and see if eating more fat makes you feel better."

An eating disorder will ruin her life, her physical and mental health and could potentially kill her. Also most people with eating disorders who do not go to therapy will suffer from it chronically for the rest of their lives. She needs to get help as soon as possible to prevent it from becoming worse. Maybe her parents can tell her they noticed her disordered behaviour themselves and leave your name out of it? Surely they will be thankful and understand you just want to help their daughter but without her thinking you crossed a line by snitching on her."

Your partner is going to have to choose to get help on her own. You can be there, and tell her your concern (I wholly agree with the comments above) but ultimately she has to decide not just to seek help, but to accept it. (In my experience those are two different things, and equally hard to do.) Be there, be present, remind her you care about her and want her to experience live with you in the moment. If she does not open up or she refuses to realize her condition- that is all you can do besides raising concern with others to intervene if she does not herself. EDs come with serious health risks. The fact she is telling you these issues with food are in itself a cry for help, so I do not doubt that she is noticing these changes, but it is scary to be seen as needing help. You are doing the right thing, but you cannot make her choose recovery or treatment (though you can lead her there with family and her support system if necessary) she has to make that call on her own. It is hard, I know. You are taking note and I would definitely suggest asking around to get a support system of friends and family in place. But take care of yourself too. You can only do so much, and that is not a bad thing. That is human."

It sounds like the high hunger level is a trigger for you. It might be helpful to keep lots of snacks around that are easy on your stomach to avoid getting extremely hungry. Try tuning in to your hunger signals as much as you can (timed meals as mentioned in another comment can help with noticing earlier hunger signals). Even thinking about food is an early sign of hunger. Binging is typically a response to restricting. So the extreme hunger triggering a binge makes sense. Something else that does not get talked about too often is that mentally restricting (thoughts like \u201cI cannot eat this\u201d or \u201cI should not be eating this\u201d) can actually trigger binge behaviors as well. This can be difficult if you have stomach conditions (I have IBS and no longer have my gallbladder so I can relate) Sometimes shifting my mindset toward trigger foods can make a difference for binge behaviors. Choosing between \u201cam I prepared for the discomfort of eating this right now?\u201d can help instead of outright telling myself something is totally off limits. Hope some of this helps!"

Personally, in my specific case, I think it is a lack of motivation, which is common with mental illnesses. It is almost like I am subconsciously rebelling against allowing the day to continue. The more stressed I get the more I want to sleep, so it almost feels like a part of me would rather just time warp past what I need to do in the day by sleeping it away. Which makes sleeping seem extra enticing first thing in the morning. I do not always get nightmares, but my dreams are usually extremely vivid too. If they are nightmares then I am kept up from them, but if they are not then I tend to want to go back to them since I preferred to live in that dream world than reality. I think therapy is the answer in my case, and it may be for you too. I saw you said you already have a therapist though? It is still very common to not have a therapist that is right for you without searching around a little bit. No shame in switching them up and trying different therapists."

It is hard to resist, but there is a whole world awaiting you on the other side of this ideology. My recommendation is to start reading. Reading is a window into a different reality, and that is what you need to get started, the mere belief that something else might be true. None of us is the first to suspect that true satisfaction lies in slowness and simplicity. Different authors speak to different people, but for me it was Mary Oliver.

And as much as my heart kind of desires it, the stresses of the last few years, particularly now I have been living alone for years, I am just sort of working to keep myself afloat, to pay bills and exist more than I am because I like my job, have made those plans to grow feel somewhat out of reach? and right now I just take it one day at a time. sometimes I feel like I am letting myself down, wasting potential, but also fuck it man, life is tough and you have to give yourself breaks and be realistic with yourself in order to ride out rough waves i am going to. take care xx"

I Do Not Know what to do - The purging started because of a near death experience I had involving a food allergy I did not know I had, and I ended up having to be hospitalized for two days because of a reaction that I had to this food. An allergic reaction to be very specific, I went into severe anaphylaxis and quite literally could not breathe nor form words whilst in the hospital for the first 5-8 hours I was there. I had to get over three rounds of epinephrine, (basically adrenaline) used for anaphylactic shock, which is an abnormal amount for an allergic reaction. Since then (happened about 2 months ago) I have had intense panic attacks anytime I eat anything other than mac and cheese. And I have never had panic attacks before, it is been such a new experience and an extremely frightening one at that. I was prescribed a benzodiazepine to assist with the physical effects of the panic attacks, but the mental panic is unwavered by these drugs and the physical symptoms have not reduced noticeably. I have yet to been prescribed something else in order to combat these mental issues relating to the panic. I am 23 y/o and have never dealt with something so incredibly intense, at least that I remember. The purging started shortly after this event, within the first two weeks. Anytime I ate anything (even mac and cheese) I felt the need to get it out of my system. Even though I knew from an allergist perspective that it would not assist in preventing an allergic reaction from whatever food I had eaten, and yet I find it hard to stop. I have begun drinking alcohol on a regular basis which assists in my purging. I buy food and basically binge eat until I have a panic attack which causes me to then purge whatever I have eaten. I really do not know where to go from here and have not had the chance to speak about this to the therapist I have been seeing since the event since the focus of our sessions is the panic relating to food. I Do Not Know what to do at this point, I feel so lost. I have never felt the need to purge before but now it seems as if it is the only option.",

I think it is on a spectrum, with healthy mindful eating on one end, and a full blown eating disorder on the other. Dieting would be in the middle.

It is been dad to see \u201cdetoxing\u201d, \u201cclean eating\u201d and fasting become such big trends with so little awareness of EDs to counteract such.

To be honest, eating disorders do not exactly stay away. What I mean is you have to learn to just ignore the disordered thoughts, because to be completely honest they will come back at times and you will just have to learn to work around them. Please encourage her to try to appreciate how wonderful her body is by thinking of the things she can do with it. She can bring a whole baby into the world, why would she hate it, or try to starve it, right? Why should anyone else\u2019s opinion matter when a female is THAT strong like omg. She should want to give it the proper nutrition that SHE needs, everyone is so different, so instead of trying to starve herself, attempt to help her affirm to herself that it is okay, and she is always allowed to take care of herself. Some people get mentally hungry which is usually a crave for certain foods, and that is alright, this happens especially during the time when a person with anorexia is all in (fighting off the disordered behaviour) and it is something we have to embrace. When anyone around her comments on food she eats or her weight, she should ask them not to, and if she is uncomfortable with doing that help her out. Do not say why, just say it is rude, it actually does help. If they do not stop and respect it, it is best to consider getting them out of her life if it is an option. She should explain to your her feelings, because a partner should be someone you are comfortable with and someone who will not criticise you when you are going through a touch time. She could try to face fear foods(slowly but surely, i had extreme anxiety when it came to this but had to try my hardest, it helped when people who supported me and i knew were not judging me were around), which are typically foods that she probably really enjoyed before she got anorexia. It may be difficult especially if it is a food that has been labelled \u2018unhealthy\u2019 by diet culture, but please help her remember no food is as bad as starving will be for her. Remind her she can eat what she pleases, but she should also try and get food with good nutrients in them to take care of her body. She can eat without distractions if that helps her, it is easier to focus on what she is doing, which will be eating of course(if she has decided to go all in with recovery, or even just recover slowly at her own pace), and her emotions, analysing them and you could be there to reassure her if it is needed.(this is what i found helped me a little) Starving herself will NOT help with weight loss which I assume she knows (she will gain it all back in a short period of time, and at some point even if she does not stop with the eating disorder, she just will not lose weight and any food she takes in will most likely be stored as fat). It will also ruin her metabolism, which in turn, will not help her out either. Basically, she needs to try and learn how to fight off the negative disordered thoughts, which you may be able to assist in if you find a way that works for you both. I do not know if this will help or if any of it will make sense, but i truly hope it does. Her body is beautiful, it is just something that takes a long time to realise. I know it is extremely difficult for her, and even you to witness it, just give it time and i really do hope she gets better, along with myself to be honest."

I wish I never had these problems to begin with, or they were dealt with sooner. If they were, maybe I would be normal. Normal is now a concept to me though, and I do not know if I will ever truly feel it. I hope one day you do get to a point of stability and normalcy. I doubt it will be a sudden transition, so you will adjust as you progress. Try not to fear being mentally healthy, as once you get there, I am sure it will be everything you have wanted. Although I do not know you, I am sure you have a personality outside of your illnesses. Our judgements are clouded so it is hard to see the truth, but the people who say you are more than your mental illnesses are being honest. There is probably a lot to you that you just cannot see, but one day you will. I wish much luck on your journey."

But you also do not want to unnecessarily worry or burden a kid. You do not want to leave them wondering or worried about whether you are safe, or that the same thing is going to happen to them. I strongly suggest talking to the parents to find out what they are comfortable with their child knowing, and what they think their child can handle and understand. If they think it is too much, then you can make up a story. I strongly believe in being honest with my own children, but I also know there may be times where I would be uncomfortable with someone other than me having those conversations with them?

Your metabolism can temporarily be raised to deal with the higher input of food. Your body could also be screaming for more after having been restricted so long. I heard a great analogy for binging: It is like holding your breath. Breathing is so natural, so necessary. Holding your breath (restricting) can only go on for so long before you NEED to breathe. And you do not just breathe, you gasp for breath after holding it for so long (the binge). You might still be gasping. Still needing to take in more.

Feeling anxious when my partner was not around, checking my phone if he texted. The root of it is usually subconscious fear of loss. I felt like I wanted to break up with my partner too because it was so overwhelming. I started therapy and this is where I learnt about my anxious attachment style. If you have the resources available, I would definitely recommend therapy. It really helped my process my relationship anxiety and separation anxiety. If you do not have the resources available, simply google it and learn some tips on steps you can take to slowly become more secure. You are worthy of the love you are receiving from him You say he is great, sweet, romantic and well mannered. That is amazing I know it feels scary when he leaves but remember he is totally into you I learnt about things I can ask from my partner that helped ease the separation anxiety. Such as checking in, or simple reassurance went a long way. Again, there is nothing wrong with you and you are not a bad person. Your attachment is simply activated. Once you have awareness, it helps because you can understand what is happening and why. Wishing you lots of luck You got this"

I am in no position to tell you what to do but this is my advice ; If you feel you were better off and more mentally and emotionally stable a year ago in comparison to now then you need to look into it. Find out WHY you feel like you do. Have you gotten emotionally attached to your bf ? Has he become a pillar to you ? Do you feel you cannot be happy without him ? Things like that. I would like you to understand that there is more to love than just being together with someone. You can still love each other even if you were not dating. If he really does care about you, he will understand. Just explain to him EXACTLY what you feel, do not hold back. Make it clear you love him but being in a relationship right now is not working for your well being right now. If he cares, he will understand and still be there for you, still be your friend, still love you. And if you lose friends because of breaking up with him then honey they are not your friends and you should not waste your time with them. Do what is best for you. Take care of yourself.

I ask and say this because I am a therapist who mostly works with kids and I cannot tell you how many times a kid has misinterpreted trying to process their behavior for calling them out and trying to make them feel bad. I had a minor who went through trauma who almost seemed like a robot thinking they had to recite their trauma and I redirected them because that could be re-traumatizing or more harmful than helpful. What did they tell their guardian? That I told them I am not in session with them to talk about the trauma and told them I did not want to talk about, totally not what happened and extremely misinterpreted. What would make your therapist objectively bad in this scenario is if you addressed these feelings with them and they did not resolve it, process this, or clarify. Take your concerns about your therapist to your therapist. How can they help you and improve their communication with you if you do not tell them what you need?"

        "completion": "I am going to be real with you: being put in a psych ward against my will at 16 was slightly traumatic. BUT it was because of my personal circumstances. I was there for one week and I live in Hungary so I have limited experience and knowledge about what you are might be getting into but here is what I know nonetheless. I hope it helps. First of all I was already going to therapy and had a developing support system that I was taken out of. You on the other hand do not seem to have a stable support system at all and would probably benefit from the attention of professionals and people with similar issues (aka you could even make some friends although in my experience it is a hit or miss. But you will definitely benefit from hearing similar stories from people in similar but just different enough situations, trust me). If you feel like you need help you are probably right. Getting away from your parents, whatever the exact situation might be would also seem like a good idea based on what you wrote. In sum I definitely recommend talking to a therapist and it might even be beneficial for you to go to hospital although that depends on the hospital itself. Also you should definitely ask your therapist about being hospitalised, especially if you are afraid to be open because of the uncertainties surrounding it. They will have better answers suited for you than any of us here on reddit. I am not sure about your local place's rules but in my experience and what I heard in other places as well they take your phone away. We had one hour daily to use our phones, which overlapped with the one hour that visitors were allowed so I practically could not use it at all because parents always bugged me to pay attention to them lol. Entertainment wise they provided a lot of things, from art supplies through TV to guided activities and even played with us if none of the other patients were willing so I did not miss social media but I did miss being able to communicate with my friends. If you get put in a hospital your legal guardian will know about it. I am not sure if you can prevent them from visiting you as I never had an issue like that but you should talk about a doctor with it. I am sure you are not the first one who would have an issue like that (if you even want to prevent them. That is just the vibe I got from your post). They will also most likely see the reports that the doctors write about you, which can be very scary, I know. In my experience it does not contain very specific things, just general statements. For me these reports (or at least the parts in laymans terms) were 3-4 short paragraphs long where at least one would be taken up by my background (how old I was, what my hobbies were, where I went to school, etc). This was in every report, I assume, for the purpose of informing any other doctor or therapist that might take my case about the basic info needed about me. A report like this was produced after every one-on-one talk, sometimes including psychological tests. The 2nd-3rd paragraphs were taken up by the contents of these talks and tests, again, general tastements, almost bulletpoints about the most important things. The last paragraph would talk about diagnoses, suspected and outruled problems. So do not be scared because of this. Having your parents know about stuff is a necessary sacrifice for the betterment of yourself. This is also something I had to come to terms with and was very uncomfortable at first. But you have to understand that this is a \"necessary evil\" for things to get better. GOING TO HOSPITAL WILL NOT RUIN YOUR LIFE /in most cases Unless you get sent to a very bad mental hospital that worsens your condition, you will not really lose from this. For the duration of your stay there you will probably not go to school, unless they let you go online, however a lot of the time it is an important point to let people there take a rest from school or work. If that means missing an exam based on how severe your situation is they might just say that you will have to take it next year. But trust me, they know what they are doing. If they say you need to miss the exam, you are probably better off missing that exam >than killing yourself over it if you get what I am saying< Record of you being there will of course be in your medical records and your GP will probably know about it. I think there are aa few diagnoses and medicines that would prevent you from driving a car for example or if you are very violent they might prevent you from becoming a teacher and prohibit you from getting a firearm. But these are extreme cases and >unless you killed or raped someone< getting a diagnoses will not have any serious negative effects. On the contrary it will greatly help you, your caregivers and your doctors in understanding your problem and its possible solutions so do not shy away from it. Also, I am not a lawyer but to my knowledge you have zero obligation to disclose your medical history to your regular old job provider unless it is relevant to the actual work. If anything this will only help you with overcoming your issues and being more balanced in the future - aka having a better life. I cannot stress this enough. If you feel like you need help, get help It will most likely actually help Throughout this comment I talked about inpatient treatment aka: you sleep there, eat there, shower there and cannot leave unless they let you. Based on your specific circumstances you might be put in outpatient care. We had one outpatient girl who slept and showered at home. However from 8-16 (I do not remember the exact time but for the majority of the day) she was mandated to be there in the hospital and follow the same rules as us aka: not leave without supervision unless allowed and follow the activities of the group. She ate with us, etc. but would go home at the end of the day. Whether you go inpatient or outpatient is based on some factors: First and foremost how much of a threat are you to yourself and/or others and how safe are you at home? If you are eligible for both inpatient and outpatient and the hospital has the capacity (aka: enough beds, food, caretakers, etc) they might let you choose what you prefer. After they let me out they said they would welcome me if I wanted to continue this in outpatient care. Last addendum: I saw a lot of people comment bad things about mental health care in the states. I have no experience with that and hearing about the absolute state of american health care saddens me greatly. I might be a bit too optimistic because I had - regardless of some traumas - actual positive experiences with therapists and the hospital I was in. But that is Hungary. Please, please ask a local professional - either a therapist or your GP - about your situation before getting into all of this I am not even sure if you are in the states - regardless, ask someone local about this who know their stuff  I hope at least you get some idea about mental hospitals from this! And I really wish for your situation to get better <3 if you have any questions you can also just message me if you would like, I will answer everything I can(although I might not be the most experienced) I remember how scary it was not knowing anything that went on."

        "completion": "Definitely not the right way to handle this, especially if you were aware of her history with disordered eating. You can absolutely suggest working out together but agreeing that she had gained weight when she was obviously insecure about it was not the right move. You should have phrased it as \"no but I am happy to work with you if you feel that way.\" Mom's are brutally honest and it is very common for people with EDs to have many issues stem from their relationship with a parent. Her friends were smart to disagree and guide her away from the thought. You not only cemented the idea of weight gain in her mind, you also implied that it was bad and moved the focus to her diet. She is likely now going to focus on her diet which heightens the risk of her restricting."

        "completion": "In addition to these other helpful replies, one thing to keep in mind about eating disorders is that for many people with restrictive EDs, weight is associated in strange ways with more abstract emotions like acceptance and love - it has nothing to do with the actual physical reality of the weight. I am sure it is different for everyone, but for me, it is kind of like I am speaking in code without realizing it when I ask whether or not I am fat. What I am honestly asking is \u201cdo you love me and do you accept me?\u201d But it can be hard to address those things head on, even now when I am pretty recovered. Obviously this is not everyone with an ED. But thought it might be something to consider as you reflect on your past convos with your ex and process the relationship you had. I do not think there was a clear right and wrong here - it was simply a mistake made from ignorance about a complex topic. And though it is best for the relationship to be over if one person is ready for it to end, it is clear that you had love for your ex and did not know how this reaction would affect them. I am glad you used this as a chance to learn more about this and are willing to accept that your actions can have significant consequences even if you do not mean for them to. I really hope that the way you are approaching conflict here helps you form a new but equally meaningful relationship soon."

        "completion": "This is not a 1:1 analogy, but think about how someone in recovery from alcoholism has a completely different relationship with alcohol than someone who has never struggled with substance use. What alcohol means to that person, what harm alcohol has done to that person, what being in environments where others are drinking is like to that person--all of that is fraught with baggage and history that could send them down a path they would rather avoid. Many people are sober because they have decided it is best to just not go there. For people with eating disorders, this is similar to their relationship with weight loss/diet/food/etc. For some, the health risks from \"trying to lose x pounds\" are analogous to a recovered alcoholic \"just having one drink.\" It is not the minor weight loss or one beer that is dangerous; it is the action that triggers a relapse into old behaviors that is dangerous. From a \"health\" perspective, the destruction caused by an unmanaged restrictive eating disorder is often worse than being a higher weight than desired. I also want to validate that this does not make sense to people who have never had these experiences! Again, not a perfect analogy, but I hope it helps illustrate the point. Sorry for what is going on, OP."

In this statement you made the assumption that minor weight gain was a problem and needed solving. This is the core of the issue with your approach. All of this is not helpful for 90% of people especially for anyone with a past ED. As much as you might think it is supportive, it is not. Its going to come off as shaming for their eating choices, create anxiety for minor weight fluctuations, and create shame around a lack of exercise/or fixation around over exercise. All of these are especially challenging when you have/had an ED. Furthermore, weight fluctuations are a part of life, no matter who you are, and knowing its not something that will affect your relationships is important to most people."

Look at why girls are not seeming to like you, and there is always room for improvement. I see other commenters say you are falling down the incel pipeline and I hope it is not too late for you. you might just be a generally socially awkward person maybe try looking online for friends who are girls with the same interests! see what helps the friendship grow, and then use what you have learnt to try to date. being 19 and a virgin is not weird or hopeless, people find love at different times. you have got your whole life ahead of you."

Which is nonsense because there is a hell of a lot of guys with eating disorders out there. Just there is less of a support system for them to be open about it, so there is less publicity. So male rating disorders are not talked about, and men suffer as a result. So I completely empathise with the feeling of isolation. Speaking up on reddit is a brave first step though Have you told anyone or sought out help elsewhere? A friend or family member, or failing that an eating disorder charity, or therapy? Therapy helped me massively, especially as I was too anxious to tell anyone about my eating disorder at the time. Good luck and take care"

        "completion": "Statistics from the UK's Nat. Inst. for Clinical Evidence: although this is not as effective as seeing a therapist, many people suffering from anxiety benefit from self-help. In recent years, evidence for therapeutic breathing has been very encouraging. The self-help I am describing here is not complicated. When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There is two ways to get rid of those thoughts. One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each. When you are calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Do not make mountains out of molehills. When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better. Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes. The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication. Do not overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety. Video - a lot of helpful information, including the 3-part program of Brown and Gerbarg -  Freedom from Self-Harm: Overcoming Self-Injury with Skills from DBT and Other Treatments This book has been endorsed by Marsha Linehan, who created DBT, the best treatment for borderline personality disorder, which has serious self-injury as a frequent symptom. There is a wide variety of treatments. Very severe cases require months of intense therapy but many people do well with a treatment that is just a booklet and a few therapy sessions, usually 2 or 3. Treatments that only reduce self-harm are considered successful. The less you self-harm the stronger you are and better able to deal with the problems that led to your self-harm. Likewise, the better you are in dealing with the underlying problems the more it reduces the self-harm."

Do not 'just check in on it'. Try some thing that will get you slowly outside: rake the yard, dig a small garden plot, go for a walk around the neighborhood...things that are outside the box you have been sequestering yourself in. And do not be afraid to fail Getting outside will help you get comfortable outside of your safe haven of your room. Once you are comfortable outside, expand it out further: find a hobby shop, a club you can join, something that will again push you slowly out of your comfort zone, and get you meeting people and socializing. Again, do not be afraid to fail Try it for a month, if you are not enjoying the experience or the results, try something different. The key is you keep trying new things, really trying to find things you enjoy, but outside your house. Again, do things things, but remember failure is a part of growth. As long as you can try and learn something from your failure, it is okay. Hopefully this helps a little bit.

        "prompt": "How to stop an ED before it starts? - Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I tried to post this a few months ago but never really plucked up the courage because I was in denial about having an issue, but I think I need some help - preferably from people who have some perspective on the issue. For context, I used to be overweight and decided to go on a diet last year due to joint problems. Losing the weight felt great in terms of self confidence and general mobility but I realised once I hit my current, healthy weight, I got depressed about my results not being 'good enough'. I find myself hyper-analysing my body constantly and thinking I 'need' to fit into certain clothing sizes and taking huge blows to my self confidence if I do not. During my initial weight loss, counting calories was not a big deal to me but now I am obsessed. The thing that actually triggered me to post this is when tonight after dinner, I frantically rushed around the kitchen picking up all the food items I had eaten that day and tallied up how much everything was. I even picked a packet out of the trash to do it. Nobody in my life knows I do this, not even my partner who I consider my closest friend. I hide it from everyone because I am afraid that if I tell anybody then I will be forced to eat too much and gain weight (I had an issue with my parents doing this to me in childhood). I know my current behaviour is not normal but I have not tipped fully into purging/restricting/etc. so I feel like I have some time to prevent what is going on if I know how to. The articles online are focused more so on people who are actively dealing with EDs, which is understandable. Any help is really appreciated. I know a lot of people with mental health issues/addictions always wish they could have given their younger self some advice so if anybody has anything, please do tell.",
        "completion": "Hi there, I work with people with ED. I can imagine what you are experiencing is very mentally taxing. I like to ask people to imagine their ED as a voice in their head, talking to them and commanding them to do certain things. You are there as well and fighting against it, but sometimes, it wins the argument and you are then forced to do what it says. I am sure part of you wanted to just be normal after your dinner, but your ED (or the beginning of, or whatever you want to call it) ordered you to go count every calorie, and it succeeded in that instance. I hear that it has not gotten to the point where it is making you adopt purgatory behaviors, but I want you to realize that you have already entered into a phase of restriction. You can look up the binge-restrict cycle if you are not familiar with it. It is not a healthy cycle to be in. Eventually, the ED can become stronger and weaken your own will to stay healthy. How to get rid of it ? First, you need to understand that healing from ED is a non-linear process. There will be relapses, and it is normal and it is okay. You will also need to build a network around you. ED is not something you can fight on your own. I know it might be hard to even imagine telling people at this point, but the people that really love you will care and be there to support you through this, there is no doubt about that. Allow them to be there for you. A good ressource I like to recommend is the book Life without ED by Jenni Schaefer. The author talks about her experience getting rid of her ED. I think it could be a good start for you. You can also look into support groups in your area. They are usually free services offered by non-profits, and you could get to share with people living similar experiences. Remember the first step is to acknowledge there is a problem, and you have achieved that already, you can be very proud of yourself. Keep loving yourself, and best of luck :)"

        "completion": "Hi there. What a deja vu. I have seen this movie and I know how it ends\u2026 In my case it was 2016. I was at the same spot\u2026 In a span of two weeks, work got so stressful, I did so much coke one night that I could not get out of my room next morning. Had to call in sick. And again. And again. I lost control. I lost the job. Cocaine addiction can escalate pretty fast. I spent about two years (2015/2016) in heavy addiction. I mean heavy. Four day benders. Almost oded a few times. Nothing made me stop, until I lost my job and it hit me in the face. I tried to quit on my own for a while, I spent three months in bed eating and sleeping and fighting the urge to go out and buy more. Then I had a nasty relapse. I only got the grip on recovery when I started seeing a therapist. She helped me get my life back on track. So my tip, from someone that has been in the ups and downs of coke recovery since 2016, is get professional help. Go to a group or get a therapist, or a doctor. It is so much easier and effective when you have someone guiding you. Be patient and be strong. It took me several months to stop shaking and feeling dizzy out of the blue. I felt numb and stuck for a long time, until I started going on long morning walks, that really changed everything. Go to bed early, try to go for walks in the sun, lots of sun, eat heathy (but keep ice cream in hand, ice cream is wonderful to cut the cravings) and keep busy during the day. Keep so busy that when party time comes you are so tired, all you want is a good night sleep. You will thank yourself in the morning. Also I had to change all of my friends. I only felt really free from coke in 2021. I almost slipped back during 2020\u2026 Had to let go of all my party people. Up until this day, I do not trust myself around coke, so I avoid people and places where I know there will be blow. The hardest thing you already did, that is admitting you have a problem. You can do this. Trust me, it is worth it. Life is so much better without cocaine. Good luck"

        "completion": "Psychosis can be stabilized but it can take several months. If I were in your shoes I would push to keep him in the hospital as long as possible, and I would try to find a residential treatment center he can step down to once he is discharged. They have places that specialize in treating psychotic features. He might have to go out of state for one that is specific but it is worth it. Insurance will cover these places when medically necessary. You have to do some Google searching to find one that focuses on mental health, a lot of them are for drug addiction recovery but there ARE mental health ones. You will have to see who takes your insurance. If he is on Medicaid you can call them to ask for help finding a program. As for your other kids being mad at you for bringing him home, they need to stop being so cruel hearted. As long as your son is willing to take meds and be treated there is no reason he cannot eventually come home. FYI there are antipsychotic meds that can be given by injection and last a long time. That will make it easier to get him stable since he does not have to remember pills everyday, but yeah you have got a minimum of 2 months of recovery for him, may be much longer. The first psychotic break can be pretty rough. I recommend you find a Reddit for people with psychosis to talk to them about how they manage their symptoms. He may have a lifelong mental illness that needs management but that does not mean the rest of his life is going to be as bad as it is now. Do not lose hope. "

Journal - write down your anxious thoughts. what worries you the most, is anything else bothering you, are you catastrophizing? Talk it out - do you have a family member, friend or classmate that would be willing to listen to you vent and air your concerns? Therapy - if its within finanical reason, consider speaking to a therapist Dissociation - I love using this technique. You know that little voice in your head that tell you you will fail, there is not enough time, you will get kicked out of school, your parents will be so dissapointed etc etc? I cannot stress this enough, this voice is not you Just becuase you hear it in your head does not mean it is true. A good method for this is one of my favorites. Imagine for a moment that you are sat on a sofa, and this voice in your head saying all this negativity is another person sat with on on this couch. Listen to them talk. Listen to how they ramble on and on about all this negative stuff. Its getting tiring, annoying and frustrating. So walk away It sounds silly to some, but making this kind of distinction of \"I am ME and I am NOT my thoughts\" is an incredibly useful tool. Meditation or self hypnosis - as a hypnotherapist, i may be bias here, but hear me out Meditation and self hypnosis is an incredible tool to ease mental health and stress issues. There are many guided tools available online, you just have to find one that speaks to you I hope this helps you"

        "completion": "That is something you have to admit truthfully to yourself. As someone who works with addicts, and is personally affected by life with an addict-there is no point in others telling you you have a problem. You have to find that truth in yourself and admit that you are powerless over cocaine. Being powerless does not mean you cannot quit, it means you know that one is too many, and a thousand is never enough. If you cannot put it down, and one line is never enough, you know you do not have power over cocaine, cocaine has power over you. If you feel this is true, then there is hope and there is an answer-sobriety. Life without that cocaine can be beautiful, and the cocaine use does not dictate a good time. You do. Your body, mind, finances, social life and future will all be destroyed if you keep on this path. You deserve a good life, you deserve to be happy, and you deserve freedom. I have had unsuccessful resuscitation of patients who went into cardiac arrest from use alone, or from patients who had their cocaine cut with fentanyl or other harmful tranquilizers. Every addict thinks-its not going to happen to them. That they are the exception. Please take care of yourself, there is a good world out there. It deserves you in it."

        "completion": "In essence, addiction is caused by trauma. Healing that trauma is part of becoming sober. However, the addiction itself causes further trauma. The way of healing this is generally to understand, forgive and change. If the traumas are still there there may be more work to be done. I suggest some sort of contemplative practice, like meditation or journaling. Talking to yourself can be very effective too. The main intent should be to be curious and compassionate. Internal Family Systems view the self as a collection of parts (inner selves), some young, some old, some hurt and weak, some strong and safe. Ask those parts how they feel about what happened, what the you of today could do for them, or if a future you could support them. Both visualizing these acts of atonement, forgiveness, etc and actually acting in the present and future to atone and heal can be helpful to heal these traumas. If any of this is unfamiliar as to the root trauma causing the addiction I would use the same approach there too. Best wishes"

        "completion": "Hi, there. Fellow coke addict here. When I first tried to quit coke, after a few years of heavy abuse, I managed to get three months clean, and when I was feeling better I started yoga. I felt so good and so happy about it Guess what? I relapsed hard. Got a few more months clean, was feeling so happy, relapsed. When I finally decided to get help, one of the first things I learned in therapy is that an addict\u2019s comfort zone is down the hole. Our minds tricks us into not accepting happiness, like if we do not deserve it. It is a mix of guilty and fear and self-sabotage. So you have tools in therapy to reset this behavior and go back to \u201cnormal\u201d. To me it was a long process of learning to love myself, to love and cherish my life, my family, my friends, my work, my clients\u2026 I used coke as an escape from some really bad depression and self-destructive behaviors I had long before cocaine entered my life\u2026 I sabotaged myself in other ways, with over drinking, always feeling defensive and criticized, always angry and jealous, having meaningless one-night stands with strangers\u2026 When I tried coke it made me feel awesome and sexy and dangerous and edgy\u2026 Wow, it was the recipe for disaster and I was instantly hooked. Fast-forward to rock bottom loosing a job and almost dying, I go to therapy and learn all this awful things about myself I was not aware before. My point is: if you really want to quit, get some professional help. A good therapist can help you discover your triggers, your motives and how to break this pattern. My tools have been routine, creating good new habits, getting close to nature and sunlight, and gratitude. Be grateful. Take a look around, pay attention to all this good moments and people you say you missed, and tell yourself you deserve it. You deserve this happiness, you deserve your job, you deserve this guy you like, you deserve your your family and friends. Convince yourself how important you are to them, and how they want you to be there, and you will be your best self to be there for them and to cherish this moments. Recovery can be painful, therapy can be painful, but it really pays off. Of course life is not perfect and there will be bad days when you feel defeated and tempted to go down the hole again, but there is a point you can reach when you identify the exact moment you want to self-sabotage and you go for a walk or have an ice-cream instead of stuffing your face in blow. Use this moment of venting to take control of your life, you have the right motivation Take care and good luck!"

You should also embrace the idea that mental health counselling could help you the way it helped me. My addiction was the result of deep trauma and I needed help to process that. I am also bipolar and found that my drug use was self medication. Yours may or may not be, but studies show that about 80% of addicts have a complicating mental health diagnosis. So it is something to explore. All of that being said I am really stoked that you have made this choice and if you have any questions you can message me directly. Peace!"

The first time I was addicted it was for nearly 7 years, the withdrawals experience first time round was utterly horrendous and torturous, so I relapsed a couple of times however, I did eventually get clean and enjoyed three years before I relapsed after an infected wisdom tooth. I am currently on day four and most of my withdrawals have subsided. The one thing I do have now is much more clarity about my experience of the world around me. I am aware of why I need substances, to escape. The emptiness you feel right now, is your nervous system, not knowing how to respond without opiates present. You need to reconnect with who you are, your past, the reason why you were addicted in the first place.. take yourself for some walks, reconnect with nature, if that is your thing, of course! You will have ups and downs that is natural, and if you ever relapse like I have, please be gentle with yourself. Addiction is complex and that is why it is necessary to explore it."

I do not have close friends to hang out with, I do not have people I do not to on a daily basis, I feel like I am someone who is not really missed or cared for by peers. Sometimes it seems like no one cares to associate themselves with me. I feel isolated. I feel as if I do not have anywhere to turn. Feel like I have no one to talk to. I am predominantly lonely in my romantic life. I do not have hope I will have anyone, it seems too good to be true. I put myself in this predicament. My one relationship that I cannot break is pornography. At this point, now I am just going to pornography to fulfill the bodily pleasures I have, but to fulfill the loneliness I have. The sad thing is, I know it is the very relationship with pornography that has caused me to be lonely, caused me to seek out strangers on anonymous chat forums, caused me to go out less and become antisocial; caused me to become depressed, less motivated, anxious, stressed, dependent on pleasure, empty, calloused, broken, ashamed. I feel I cannot produce healthy relationships, friendly or romantic. My focus of romantic relationships become solely based on physical intimacy, not necessarily sexual, but touching and feeling through hugs, holding of hands. I know relationships are much more than that and certainly much deeper on an emotional and spiritual level than physical. Pornography has warped my view on others, myself, relationships, reality. It has helped me to isolate myself, develop trust issues, become broken and breaking others, distort my thinking, pervert my thoughts; prevented me to succeed and live a healthy, proactive life. I hate myself. I hate my lifestyle. After doing something for so long, you are so used to it, that though you despise it, you cannot seem to break it out of comfort. People can recognize drug addicts, alcoholics; any sort of addictive behavior. The hardest one to identify is pornography or sexual vices overall. I wish someone can recognize it and say to me, \u201cI know what you are doing\u201d that way I have no other choice but to get help.",

It does not help that fast food has chemicals in it to literally make us addicted to it. I would suggest trying some compassionate inquiry to find out why you are struggling with this temptation.

We were having a debate today that family/marriage/kids is not happiness for everyone. Peter was claiming that me and Mike need to find partners and \u201cfree ourselves to be able to have family, we are miserable because we are comfortable with our \u201cweakness\u201d aka mental problems\u201d. Me and Mike were insisting that you need to be happy with yourself first in order to be happy with someone else and Peter was just saying that we both are weak and we need to go and enjoy our life outside this weakness to be able to get rid off any problems. This just made me furious, why some people think that in order to \u201cbe happy\u201d you just need family?

Some people need others to feel truly happy and fulfilled, and other people really need to just be by themselves to fix what they struggle with. Y'know? I feel like it is one of those times where you have to walk in each others shoes.

        "completion": "\"I feel really good about myself\" \\^ Think of depression, or low points, or however you want to classify it as an issue you can take steps to solve. If you are hungry, what do you do? You eat something. If you are thirsty, you drink, and so on. If you feel low about yourself, you can try to do things that make you feel good about yourself. Obviously it is not quite that easy, depression is very counterintuitive when it comes down to it. Is there any step of the process that you can do easily? Flossing, mouthwash? Baby steps that can get you into the routine? On that note, the word routine... do you find it easy to form habits? I have heard it takes three weeks to form a habit, but is there a time of day you think you would be comfortable allotting to hygiene stuff? Me personally, I get off work, I shower when I get home. It is just the time I have set to do that, if I do not want to then I do something to force myself to fill a specific shower-sized gap of time. Case in point, if I put something in the oven that will take roughly the lenh of a shower to cook up for dinner? Well shit, that is not enough time to play a game or watch a show, I might as well just shower while it is cooking. Get out, feel clean, two-for-one because I also feel like I have managed my time well juggling a couple productive things Point is, if you can think of a spot in your day where you tell yourself \"Okay, I can free up a few minutes for this daily\", and take small steps into it, there is potential there to see yourself improving bit by bit. Make a small calendar and tick off which ones you did on a given day and get that little baby dopamine rush seeing the number go from once a week to twice, to three, or who knows what. Seeing it on paper that you are steadily caring for yourself more and more could boost that confidence, it could be as easy as \"I want to do this so I can make that check mark today\" Keep your eye on the prize. You felt good about yourself today. Chase that."

I like how it makes me feel dizzy and relaxed. the largest amount I took was 3 pills (3mg each). recently I have been using it almost every day (usually just 1) or every night so I can sleep without waking up multiple times. I am careful not to mix it with alcohol or energy drinks (I did that one time and it was really bad) but I do smoke cigarettes daily. symptoms I noticed when I skip taking it: fast and strong heartbeat (sometimes it feels like my heart stops for a moment and my breathing too, and then it goes back to normal or just beats really hard), feeling nervous, anxious, light-headedness (sometimes), fast breathing and panicking because I am not sure if I am about to have a heart attack or faint or it is just anxiety. I feel like I am going crazy. I am also unable to cry anymore, not sure if it this is related to my addiction. I crave it both mentally and physically. the minute it goes down my throat I feel at ease, but I would have to wait 30-60 mins before the physical symptoms go away. lately only 1 pill a day is not enough.

Giving yourself the permission and taking on the personal responsibility of doing so.

Who knows really what the consequences of that might be. More than that though, how would/might this impact your relationships? With your wife and children? What is the worst possible outcome that you might face here? What is the best possible outcome you could achieve? And looking at both of them; is the person you want to be? It would be unusual for you not, from time to time, to have intrusive thoughts. If you are tired, from not enough sleep. Or maybe you are not interacting enough in meaningful relationships with people; your environment really plays a massive role here. Well, it can start to play a trick or two on you. You start to have doubts; \"Oh, just once - what harm can it really do?\" Sometimes you just have to acknowledge that you are not feeling great about life or some aspects of it. And then just say; \"Okay, so I am feeling / thinking these things. They are just thoughts. I do not need them, so I can let them go.\" And you really can. That is the power you have now; you can make a choice. Sometimes we do not realise how much influence in the outcomes of our lives, and that there is a space for us to make a choice. We can influence our impulses. I wish you well. I really do. You made a choice to come and get support. That is shows you have a level of depth and maturity. That you care. Things may still provoke or irritate you, but do not forget that you have come so far already. And you still have a way to go. Just how that turns out, lies at your feet."

I have continued to play music and festivals as well. Everything in my life has improved since getting clean and sober. Well.... Almost everything. I am starting to feel the effects of sobriety after the last decade. I feel a lack of relaxation, perspective, and adventure. Sometimes I feel it is more accessible to drink when going out with friends and my wife. Restaurants, festivals, bars, parties and friends ONLY have booze. Water and soda is very rare. I still have not even had any alcohol. I have no urge to return to my drug of choice (opiates and pills in general), but the idea of marijuana as a legal supplement does sound relieving. Am I saving my life? Or am I over doing this and throwing a great deal of it away? Anyone dip a toe in? Does anyone else feel this way a decade in?",
        "completion": "My drug of choice was weed and it is addictive despite what people tell you, and after continuous use the withdrawals are horrible. I would not underestimate weed, it is a drug. I would strongly advise against dipping in that toe. Weed ruined my life. You are just living life by life\u2019s terms, there are ups and downs, maybe find some new coping mechanisms or hobbies :)"

Sure I could start off moderating and keep it like that for quite some time, but eventually the one drink a month will turn to 5 and that will turn to a daily habit. If I am getting drunk, what is a little bit of coke going to hurt? Once I have a little bit of coke, what is one more line? Then one more? Ok just another bump. Ok time to call my dealer. It is an incredibly slippery slope, one that is impossible for me to balance on in perpetuity. I will go back to as bad as I was before if not worse. Why put all my hard work in jeopardy when I know I will regret it and kick myself after the fact? I can just get ahead of all that and not drink at all, which will guarantee I am not going to \u201caccidentally\u201d get drunk and do a bunch of coke once my inhibitions are lowered by that initial few drinks."

If you do not feel like going to the barber right now and then do not. It is good to expose yourself to uncomfortable situations but you are too uncomfortable do not push yourself. I get a depression beard cuz it is just too much and that is okay. You are appearance should be for you first and foremost. 2) for the therapist, check your insurance and see who is in network. Also see if you have any drug clinics in your area who do mental health; in my area a lot of them do, and in fact my councilor is out of a rehab center and they are great. 3) once you find a therapist, see if they are willing to do telehealth. Since the pandemic providers are now more open to that and your ins should tell you also if they do it as well. Helps to have therapy in a place that makes you comfortable. 4) do not fuck with your medications. If you were running out contact the hospital who prescribed them to see what they can recommend or do. As you experienced a sudden stop of those will make things a lot worse for you; conversely, taking too much is not good either as, at least in my case, some meds can also be muscle relaxers and really mess with you. 5) the doctors and therapists are paid by you to help you. It is their job. They went to school to help people. Let them help you. It will hurt, you may feel like it is bs or it is not for you but you have to stick with it, even though it hurts. And finally: 6) do not stop talking. This is something that I have grown to accept I need to do-keeping what your feeling is not healthy, and I am sure you have friends and family to help. If you do not, you reached out for help here which shows you want to get better so keep talking, work through it, and keep going."

I understand that some people can do it occasionally without developing a critical issue, but I do not feel super confident in my friend's ability to self-regulate. As such, I want to set a clear boundary about how much cocaine use I can tolerate from him, something along the lines of \"if you do cocaine more frequently than X amount of times per X unit of time measurement then I will have to re-evaluate our friendship.\" Is once per month reasonable?

AFAIK he was clean for a few months, then he took cocaine again. He told me that his therapist has agreed that it is fine to do cocaine occasionally, as long as he does not do anything harder. My question is: how often is actually reasonable? I understand that some people can do it occasionally without developing a critical issue, but I do not feel super confident in my friend's ability to self-regulate. As such, I want to set a clear boundary about how much cocaine use I can tolerate from him, something along the lines of \"if you do cocaine more frequently than X amount of times per X unit of time measurement then I will have to re-evaluate our friendship.\" Is once per month reasonable? I would feel more comfortable with maybe once every two or three months, but is that too restrictive? Or am I going about this totally wrong? I want to set a boundary, yes, but I also want it to be a limit that he can reasonably adhere to. Sorry for the essay. Grateful for any advice.",
        "completion": "A boundary is for you, not the other person. For example, telling your friend you care about them and hope they get the help they need but will not spend time with them when they are high is a healthy and reasonable boundary. You mention that a few months ago, to your knowledge, he was clean. Clean is something we say in the rooms/recovery to indicate we are no longer using mind altering substance. There is a zero percent chance any therapist is encouraging him to use any amount at any time if he struggles with substance abuse. It sounds like you care a lot about your friend and I think you have good intentions behind wanting to help him. Your feelings and well being matter. It is not your place to set any limits on how much he uses, his use will only ever be up to him. What you choose to allow in your life is up to you."

She is like a wolf with a paw in a trap. When you try to help the wolf you get teeth and rage. The longer their paw is in the trap the harder they bite when you get close to them to help. The constant worrying about 'is today the day?' is finally over. The finality of it all means now you can grieve and begin to move on. Please do not put it on yourself. Grieve the way you need to, adding undeserved guilt into it makes it harder to 'recover'. We that remain never really do 'recover' from the death of a loved one.

Looking back now I can see that my issues where there from the start, violence in the home and family dynamics etc. I used whatever I could to numb the pain I was in. Gradually going from one thing to another as the tolerance builds up and it no longer numbs the hurt and confusion.

Today I work every day at growing, I battle everyday with thoughts, and old behaviours but the thing I always keep close to me was the times that I genuinely did not care if I lived or died , or the feeling of complete hopelessness that I could ever get to where I am now. I help people when I can who are going through the things in life that so many have to deal with like domestic abuse, addiction, mental health issues etc., but ultimately I have to stay focused in my lifelong fight against making one more bad choice that could lead to going back down a road I may not return from.

He has a a few relapses that I caught since then, but to my knowledge nothing really in at least 3-4 years. He just uses thc pens regularly now. Today I got all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed and was prescribed 8 hydrocodone with i think acetaminophen. It is listed as Norco, which I know he is taken on occasion in the past. So he was already asleep and I went to take one before bed as my pain was getting worse, I dumped them to count them and there are only 6. I have not taken a single one yet. My ibuprofen and antibiotic are fine but not norco is missing 2. I also struggle with the fact a that his addiction is with him probably forever because he to this day has not gotten professional help or ever been to therapy like he has promised me so many times over at least the last 2 years. I am frustrated and I am hurt. I need to ask him but I do not know what to do or how to do it. I understand to certain extents the way he hides and lies with slip ups, and it is nearly ended or relationship at least once.

        "completion": "First off, so sorry you are going through this. IRD incredibly painful to watch the ones we love do things that hurt us and themselves. A few thoughts I have\u2026 1. An addict has an addiction that stays with them forever regardless of if they get professional help or not. Professional help (therapist, 12 steps, SMART recovery, treatment program, sponsor, support network, etc) is to develop tools and new coping mechanisms with an aim to increase the likelihood of staying sober. The addiction will always be in the background, that is why guys with 20 years sober still say they got there \u201cone day at a time\u201d. 2. Do not ask him, because he might deny it and that will make you crazy. Always trust your gut. Tell him you know and do not need to argue or prove you know. Do not give in or give room to negotiate what you know happened. Walk away if you have to and go silent and wait. 3. Set boundaries, and make sure you are prepared to follow through. Anger or hurt feelings without boundaries does not inspire changed behavior. Boundaries without follow through erase your credibility. Consider things like \u201cI will not be in a relationship with an addict who is not pursuing recovery and following all treatment recommendations\u201d. Or \u201cgoing forward all narcotic medication will be going on a safe only I have the combination to\u201d. 4. If he will not get help, you can for you, therapy, and alanon /naranon, etc are available for you to help you navigate. Best of luck OP."

You obviously cannot control him, and forcing him to do anything is likely to backfire. But you might gently suggest that he look into doing more for himself in terms of self improvement. I do not think relying on Buprenorphine indefinitely is a smart move. You got to get to the root of the problem, and learn to be happy enough to not want to use, and not need anything else.

There was physical/emotional abuse in the home that only intensified and mutated as our family fell apart. My siblings and myself ended up in different homes that were each subjected to various unhealthy circumstances. I was never the A+ kid at school, but I did well enough to not really stand out. I began to really struggle during my parents divorce. I was shamed for doing poorly in school and was not given an opportunity to have any additional tutoring to catch up, most specifically with math. Even to this day I get anxiety when certain things are explained to me, as though I can consciously feel my brain not absorbing the material. I ended up being removed from my father's house due to physical abuse (although there were different types of abuse occurring in both homes) and I went to live briefly with my mother and then eventually with my older sister due to my mother's inability to be a functional parent. In all of the chaos I dropped out of high school. I was able to get my first job at 16 and obtained my GED at 18. I went to Job corps due to being on the verge of homelessness at 18. I got my CNA license, but found that type of work was too much to handle on top of my depression and anxiety. I worked various jobs in the food service industry and retail before committing to Welding at my local trade school.

Second, you mention math and say when things are explained to you, you brain does not absorb the information, then you struggle around the mathematical part of welding blueprints, you also never had the support you needed when dealing with math at school ( tutors) I am going to hazard that you have an intense anxiety related to mathematics, when overwhelmed with anxiety our brains simply cannot function, when i was unaware of my anxiety and it is effects, I honestly thought that I became mentally challenged, it effects everything, perception, performance, you physical and emotional balance. You did not graduate the welding program because of your incompetence, as you said, 60 percent of the applicants left. You did not. You are not incompetent and I would wager my life on it. Obviously, I bet you were told about therapy many times it is a very common type of advice, it is worthwhile but it all depends on the \"fit\" you and the therapist have, you might have to try a few (I tried 6 until I found the one who saved my life) I suggest that you attempt to tackle your issues with anxiety, but not by yourself, and not against your own will (this is important) in the meantime any work you can find is ok, its just an interim period while you learn how to be aware of and manage your emotional wellbeing. It is difficult, but it is worth it."

Let us just say that \u201ccuriosity\u201d turned into something more. I could not get enough of this stuff. A \u201cSaturday night only\u201d thing turned into a weekend thing. Then, It turned into me smoking on school nights. From there, it is just gotten out of hand. Since 15, I have taken 3 T breaks. That is it. With all this being said, I have gotten myself stuck. Weed has ruined me. I used to be this fun, energetic kid filled with life and happiness. (It is kind of funny, I would always say to myself before all of this \u201cwhy do people get sad? Just be happy\u201d). I found myself stoner friends that just encourage my weed addiction and vaping. I barely have any motivation anymore and the \u201canxiety of life,\u201d as they call it, is really getting to me. I am not happy with the person I have become. I Am scared for who I might become. I feel sluggish, brain dead, and unmotivated all the time. Weed has become me. And I feel if I keep staying on this road, it will end me. Does anyone have any suggestions for quitting?",
        "completion": "That is tough, but the good news is that you are aware of it and looking for help. One suggestion I have heard from people who have successfully quit or reduced their weed use is finding alternative ways to manage stress and anxiety, whether that is through exercise, therapy, meditation, or anything else that works for you. Another thing to consider is reaching out to a support group, like a 12-step program specifically for people trying to quit or reduce their weed consumption. They can provide a community of other people who are going through the same thing and offer accountability and support as you navigate this process. Finally, it might be worth trying some CBD products like  as a way to manage symptoms of anxiety or stress without the negative side effects of THC. CBD products will not make you feel high, but they might help you feel calmer and more relaxed."

One thing I always wished I could hear was, \"is there anything I can do differently that will make this less difficult for you?\" Because I had such a hard time bringing up things that bothered me. Offering to let her help or at least see when you make food will help her because she will want to know what is in the food she eats. Ask her safe foods, and if you are able to, go buy them if she is okay with having them. Try to avoid having trigger foods around. She may or may not be comfortable telling you what those are just yet, but a general rule is not keeping junk food, keeping plenty of vegetables, low-sugar fruits, and lean protein sources is a good start. I cannot speak for everyone, but for most of us that is going to be the most comfortable. You are doing a wonderful job. You are seeking help for her sake. She is so, so lucky to have you loving her.

The only thing that would help him is unconditional love, that he feels secure that he will not be rejected for having this addiction. As long as he hides, he will not take responsability for his addiction. I say that as an addict in recovery that used to hide from my wife. If he can go beyond the shame, he may be able to look for help, therapy or support group, that is the only way out. You can show him the way by joining yourself an al-anon support groups, it is hard to deal on your own with an addicted partner. Have a look at /r/naranon/ too."

Do not take that mindset because they are not the one in the relationship. To me as an ex addict it does sound like he is still using, does not mean all the time but having no money is a big part of addiction because it all goes on that or at the least everything you have spare goes on it. You need to address the situation and as you stated you do what to help him so it is not a witch hunt that you are doing, you are bringing it up because you care and his money situation is a red flag. He is going to be embarrassed, ashamed, maybe go into denial etc so it could take a few \u201ctalks\u201d. I get the impression you care about him and would rather resolve this . Try not to feel like it is personal in the \u201clying\u201d though because when I was struggling in my addiction i lied and made shit up because I was trapped in a circle of struggling , lying to not hurt the other person or let them down and because I was still using. It is never normal for people to have an addiction and they can just stop !. Normally it takes quite a bit of understanding and getting help etc. Hope all goes well but like I said try to be rational and addiction is hard and it can really get a hold of you and it can be scary being stuck and alone in your addiction while you are trying to make the other person think your ok \u2026.. but you struggle ."

The dumbest shit I have ever done in my life I have always been drunk when it happened. I have seen my mom have a seizure when I was younger because she had not had a drink in so long. Like normally I would not suggest doing it at your age because it is altering your brain and your brain is not fully developed yet but just smoke weed man, at least until you get a handle on being sober. I know life is shit sometimes and alcohol helps but trust me. When I was your age I was going through some similar stuff with my family and I always thought once I was older and could make my own decisions and would be in a better situation and be able to put it down easier. It does not work like that, it will never be easier to stop than right now, it will only get harder. Even if you do not drink everyday, you will learn to rely on it. You can avoid the physical part and still get mentally addicted and that is the part that people cannot seem to get away from. Just stop drinking and find a way to start saving up to get out of your situation. Treat it as if you have a three year deadline to figure out where you are going to go. I was homeless when I turned 17 and I never thought my mom would do that to me but it happened. Just take care of yourself O.P. The alcohol is not going to help you, it will only make you more okay with not helping your future self, and temporarily at that."

The sooner you get off it the better in my opinion. What I have learnt at 41 after six years of sobriety \ud83c\udf89 is that habit, is the main driving force in most addictions and is able to be changed by acknowledgement and planning. Change what you do after work. I started by making my bed in the morning and when I did it I told myself this was a day of change, I did not have to do anything more that day but with potential to do more. soon I was doing it more and more often. And then in those days I could try other things like doing press ups or making my lunch. Habits can be changed with courage and pesistance. Tackling booze and having AFD's alcohol free days is a great goal but first get used to being able to see your behavioural patterns and effect them with change. Give yourself time, being aware of your behaviour and then being able to effect it takes time and you need to find your own motivation to want to affect it. Peace brother"

If you have not gone yet come to r/stopspeeding. We are all going through/went through the same battle you are.

I started trying to remove the emotion aspect to it and view it simply in terms of my brain and habit. Your brain has created neural networks that lead you to use whatever substance or activity. You have feelings of sadness, you use, feeling of happiness, you use, until eventually your brain feels hardwired to always use. But it is not. When you get those urges, try not to panic or get angry or shamed or anything, try viewing it as a signal being shot through your head. The more you use, the more often you will get those signals. If you view them in that sense I found I had way more power to ignore. And first I would give myself 10 minutes to ignore, and by then the signals had passed and I did not want to anymore. the more you can do that, the stronger you make the neural pathway of \"craving --> stay sober\" . And it builds on itself until your brain redirects more and more easily. At first there will probably be times that you will still follow through with using because it is so habitual at that point, but you can see it as a brain malfunction and not shame yourself And I am not saying you are not hurting, and that it is simply a bad habit. There are reasons we get to that point, but it is a hell of a lot easier to deal with them when you are not stuck in the cycle of fucking over your brain and body"

I have got 14 months clean and sober now and it is the first time I have gotten past 90 days. I had almost exactly the same problem\u2026 I could not cry while sober and it felt so frustrating. I could not be lovey or show affection unless I had some drinks in me. I could not even thank someone or give a compliment. Definitely issues that stemmed back to a parent\u2019s alcoholism and irrational, erratic behavior. It took me 6 months of being clean to actually be able to cry. But then, I swear, I started crying at almost anything\u2026 happy things, sad things, just feeling empathy for another person. I started being able to show people in my life that I was thankful for them. It was difficult but I felt like I needed to do it because I would always wanted to be able to show those people that I was grateful. I know it is excruciating, trust me, I do. But, somewhere along the way, you learned you were not allowed to cry and now the only way you can is by ingesting a substance that takes down all your defenses \u2026but it is also ruining your life. If you stay off of it for long enough, you will learn how to feel all those things naturally. It will definitely feel awkward, but it will be worth it to feel whole again without something that is leeching your finances, mental health, and relationships. And I do not know if this helps, but I do not really do 12-step. It did not really work for me. I use a lot of principles from it and I may go again one day, but it is not how I got clean or got through my first year. Go check into a good rehab program and then find a good IOP program to do for a few months after that. (The rehab will definitely help you with that aftercare plan.) The friends I made in that program have been a really solid support for me these last 14 months. They say connection is the opposite of addiction, and i whole heartedly subscribe to that. I hope things get better for you. :)"

        "completion": "I have dealt with my depression for a very long time. Therapists, Group Therapy, medication, advanced treatments such as TMS. Eventually diagnosed with bipolar. Aka manic depression. One of the things I have learned along the way is that clinical depression is very often caused by a brain dysfunction. According to the \u2018Anxiety & Depression Association of America\u2019 there are six types of depression. Two include: 1) Persistent Depressive Disorder symptoms must persist for at least 1yr for adolescents and 2years for adults. 2) Major Depression requires at least 5 of 9 symptoms persisting for at least two weeks. Here is the point. Depression is most often due to a brain dysfunction of some sort. Possessions and lifestyle have very little to do with it. If there is a catastrophic event causing someone to lose everything sure, prolonged sadness possibly depression can be triggered. But the opposite is not true. Someone with depression can not overcome it by buying a bigger house, exotic cars or even a yacht. So, why are you depressed when you seemingly have a life others can only dream of?? Simple. Depression is about a brain disfunction. It cannot be remedied with possessions. Hope that helps Good luck \ud83c\udf40"

Addiction has in general but I AM GOING TO alcohol was the worst of all of them. I quit drinking almost 4 weeks ago cold turkey, It took about 2 weeks for the shaking to stop completely and i made it past. In the last 4 weeks I drank 4 times but did not make a thing of it and got myself straightened out immediately. I have made tremendous progress in every stride of my life and in every relationship and life has improved drastically in this short time. But, I am still actively using drugs and I know I need to stop but I do not want too. My DOC is meth and has been for a while, it is funny I quit meth in early dec and my drinking consumption tripled. I quit drinking and now my drug use in general has become more frequent. But none of them are causing a particular problem. I only really cute meth because it is my go to. I do NOT pay for it. It is rampant in my city and it is always free. Even when it is not offered I am the guy. I am the guy who knows a guy. So I am the one that everyone goes too when they need anything and I always get high for free. As far my loved ones who see me daily and know me see and say, the meth is not effecting my personality, my mentality, my person or my life. It is only a problem because it is meth lol and I am able to say no to do it. 3 days ago I was at my best friends and I got someone staying there a gram of meth and someone else there bought a fifth to drink with everyone. I said no to both and did not touch either. 4 days last week I was shooting heroin again, got real with myself and quit again and have had no urge to do so. my true substance problem boils down to the fact that I NEED to be on something every single day. How do I finally cross the boundary to stopping this?",

This person is bad news. They cannot love you, I hope you move on immediately. I wanted to add that if you came from a upbringing where you were not taught what it looks like to be loved, you will be drawn to these type of people. YOU have to learn what healthy love looks like. You are a giver and you want to serve, which means you need a partner who has the same traits. That is the only way it can work. One giver and one abuser/taker makes for misery."

What I have learned is, this is called \u201ctransference of addiction.\u201d Recover from one addiction and then a new one develops. Sex is a common thing addicts turn to in early recovery. It provides that dopamine rush our bodies are craving that we are not getting anymore from the previous drug of choice. My sponsor says, \u201cIt is like switching seats on the Titanic.\u201d The thing about addiction is, the drug of choice is just a symptom of the underlying disease. It could be alcohol, weed, cocaine, gambling, food, sex\u2026whatever. For me, getting to the root of WHY I have always needed these external things to feel good has been super important. And 12 step recovery has been a life saver for me. For the sex stuff, SAA online meetings has helped. Just know what you are going through is common in the world of addiction. You are not alone."

        "prompt": "I have a drug problem - I am not really sure why I decided to come in here, but I feel like I really have no other place to go. I am 22M studying finance/marketing in college. I was adopted when I was a baby and my parents are quite successful. My mother owns a company and my father comes from a very successful European family. They both attended prestigious schools and expect nothing less from me or my older sister. My older sister is a former 5-star athlete and amazing student who has started her own company and is doing masters program in Europe. My grandfather invented a pretty famous product and my father inherited the patent when he was 14 because my grandfather passed away. My father never had a good relationship with his family, aside from his mother. My grandmother was the most amazing person in the world, but that is a different story. My mother comes from a successful Midwest family and has 8 siblings and our extended family is around 200 people. I am the youngest member of my family and needless to say I have a lot of eyes and pressure on me to be successful. I decided to go straight to college after hs but never really went to class, partied a lot and basically got myself kicked out. My parents were so mad and I ended up moving out of their house, living on my own and working full time first the first time to pay for all of my own stuff. I grew up a privileged childhood and I know I have taken so much for granted and this has put a tremendous strain on my relationships with my family. Growing up my parents never really said no except when it came to drugs and partying. I was never allowed to go to parties until late in hs and I was drug tested throughout hs. This did not really stop me too much and I was in trouble a lot junior year. The only thing that was rally stopping me was that I was playimg on a high level soccer team and was being recruited to play at some smaller school. Unfortunately I got hit with a bunch of injuries and that halted my plans for college soccer. When I finally went to school I played for fin but definitely focused on just having. Fun. During the year that I left school, I started smoking weed and drinking a lot. I was working a construction/sales job and was making pretty decent money considering my situation. As the money started rolling in I started getting into cocaine. I was able to hide a lot of my stuff from my parents but I started selling carts and weed and my parents saw my bank transactions and called me out. They told me if I stop and get my shit together and do some online classes they would pay for me to go back to school. So I chilled out a bit and kept my head down and went back to school. That was 3 years ago. I have always had a big social circle and that has been by design. Do this day I am still not sure what is actually wrong with me, maybe I am a psychopath or just insanely arrogant but I have a reason for absolutely everthing I do. I make sure to plan my interactions, I choose words and leave out details in order to get stuff out of people. And it works. I do not know why or how, but I grew up in a upper middle class white family and even though I am brown, I have somehow been granted some version of classism/privilege. My sister is really the only one I talk to about this but she made the note that I one across as always laid back even when the world is burning. We will in order to stop me from losing my mind, i have started really just self medicating. I have so many issues with my body, mostly from sports and working construction, but now I know it is other things too. About 2 years ago I decided I wanted to work out and get back into shape. I started lifting like 10 times a week going 2x a day and just non stop work. I ended up hopping on sarms and it allowed me to push my body to new limits. I am the end I got hurt because I would use the sarms to numb my body and I would smoke and take preworkout to push though the pain. I was doing an summer internship at an investment firm and so my and the other interns were always doing adderal, Ritalin, or something to keep us focused. I then started getting back into coke after meeting a mutual friend at a party that deals. We ended up striking up a deal and I could get him into parties and he could sell. After the first few parties I brought him to I got a different kind of high. The high of having power. I can get into that later but basically fast forward to when school starts and me and my friends are buying 8bas every weekend doing a g and then selling the rest at parties. I started moving so much product for my guy that he was giving me free stuff just cuz he knew I would move it. Around this time I started getting into shrooms. I used them as an escape/reset when I was in a bad mental place or just had a lot going on. I have had some amazing experiences and some truly horrifying experiences (i can share) but I started microdosing a lot and would mix it with weed and cocaine. I started getting some crazy trips which led me to Molly, popper, concerta to name a few. I still do not want to get into anything stronger and acid scares the shit out of me. But basically I am at the point in my life where I am unable to sleep unless I am on something. I hate being with my own thoughts and I have started disassociated from certain things. I almost feel like I cannot distinguish what is real and what is me being high or just overthinking. I cannot tell my family for a variety of reasons. Of course it would kill them and it would mess everthing up. But the other reason is because I have never been doing better from the outside looking in. I am currently in the last rounds of interviews for some big private equity and wealth management firms. I am still dealing and making good money, I live in a party house which has only made me more popular and crave the attention more. But at the same time I feel like I am stuck in a time loop. Every week is the same. I constantly relive memories. I do not remember doing school work and yet I am doing good in my classes. I just find time to grind stuff out and I basically just live for the weekend. The reason I am writing this is because I know that I am so close to losing it. I am currently in love with my best friend and I do not know how to tell her, I know if I keep doing this amount of drugs I will die, I know that I cannot keep putting on fake smiles and pretending to like people. I have always been able to smile and be nice to people but recently I have felt myself become really mad or annoyed at absolutely nothing. But I have so many people telling me how good I am doing and how proud they are of me going back to school and landing a good internship. So i am not sure if anyone will actually see this or spend the time reading it, but I am open to anything. And I have lowkey lived a pretty crazy life and have a bunch of stories I can share.",

He got in a long-term relationship and had 2 beautiful kids and stopped taking them. Around the time we started dating COVID had hit and he lost his job and he started taking them again. At first I did not know, I thought he was just a really sleepy guy (lol). I never knew the signs. At some point we broke up, no contact at all. I found out from a mutual friend that he overdosed and went to rehab. We got back together shortly after. He ended up doing a 4 month jail stint, related to his drug use, in October and when we would talk on the phone it was the most coherent i have ever heard him. Everyone was so proud of him and kept reminding him to keep up the good work when he got home. He even converted to Islam which I know to be a peaceful and disciplined religion. He got released on Jan 29th and I just found out a few days ago that he is been taking xanax again almost every day for the past week. I do not know what to do, I have never experienced this first-hand. I feel like I have to babysit him to make sure he does not take anymore and OD. He is on 3 year probation and facing 10 years if he violates. I reminded him that even though he has not started getting drug tested yet it could happen any time then he is going to feds. He says he is ashamed, he could not fight the temptation. I love him but I cannot stop my life to babysit him. I know he has to want it for himself but I begged & pleaded with him to stop and he said he would.

It was not a punishment or anything, just a boundary my wife set for our families safety. But then I had to make the choice to drink and not spend time with my son. Look up support groups for friends and families of addicts. I like SMART Recovery, personally. I hate to say it, but it is likely your BF will get worse before he gets better. You cannot rely on hope that he will spontaneously want to get sober and your relationship will improve. That is generally not how these situations turn out...

I used to think people were lying when they said EDs were not about weight, but it is true. Whenever I traced back my ED episodes, it often began with stress from schools or sadness about other things, then I would start thinking about my weight and proceed to try to take control (and weirdly, get a dopamine hit) off binging and purging. I would try to be there for her, talk with her, distract her, whatever she wants to do when she is feeling those emotional lows- hopefully getting her mind far away enough from feeling an urge to binge and purge. But ultimately, no one can or should be held responsible for every second of someone is life, so know that it is not your fault if/when these episodes happen anyways. Sort of a side note but I would avoid making comments about her body for the most part. Even well intended comments about looking healthy can send someone with an ED into a spiral (associating healthy with gaining weight, then feeling a need to compensate). And comments about looking slim can make people with EDs feel excited and make them think they should keep up what they are doing. I hope your girlfriend is willing to talk open up about these issues to you, and if she is, you should ask her what you can do to help her with this and encourage her to seek treatment again if need be. I am glad you are trying to help her, and I hope that you are easy on yourself as EDs are incredibly difficult to understand, and ultimately, you cannot make someone break those habits; they have to choose to."

Luckily it did not make me sick). I did not plan on stopping my medication they where a major help for me however I was in a situation where I was away from home where outside factors took a really bad toll on my mental health which resulted in a month where I was very unstable. I AM OK NOW I am back home and safe and feel completely ok. pretty much a few days after getting back home I was back to normal but the thing is I do not feel any better or worse being off of my medication now compared to when I was on it and I do not want to start taking it again.

I got mine drawn yesterday around 4 PM. On quest it says if a result is pending and the status. My HIV was processing all day (makes sense since it probably did not get to the lab until last night). Now, about 24 hours after I actually had the blood drawn it changed from processing to \"results are in and provider notified\". However it says that my results will be held until Feb 18 due to certain state law (CA, PA, MD). I am not in either of those states so now I am freaking out that the test came back positive and they are waiting for my doctor to tell me? I know the test I ordered said \"if initial one is positive it will be run a few more times. If any of those are positive a Multispot test will be administered. If the Multispot test is negative a RNA test for HIV will then be run.\" My question is that would they be able to run all these confirmatory tests and RNA test within 24 hours?

First I thought it was a good thing that it was processed within a day but now wondering if they already ran all of the confirmatory tests and I am positive?

I just do not understand....my only exposures recently were making out and using my fingers/having fingers used on me. Never had a flu or anything recently.

I have been addicted to it for over a year now, but honestly I have been abusing any and every substance I have ever come across since about 15-16 years old. This is just the hardest substance I have become hooked on. Things got so bad over this last year (financially, health wise, mentally) that I had no choice, but to move back in with my parents. I have been to rehab once before, but when I wanted to go again recently ( just before I moved in with my fam ) I could not find anyone to watch my big dog. He is a handful, a sweetheart, but just a lot to deal with. My mom is home most of the time, where as my dad is a trucker and is gone for a week or so at a time. With how my dog is there is just no way my mom could look after him on her own. So yeah, being broke, and not being able to go back to rehab, staying with them was really my only and best option. I have been here a month, well a month tomorrow, and at first things were going great. I was able to stay clean for 4-5 days. Even though my mom and I have had a rough relationship through out most of my life she has been extremely supportive and understanding. Overall, my environment here with my family has been good, probably the best it is ever been since I was way younger. However, I started using again within the first week of being here, and I have not told anyone in my family about it because I do not want to keep hurting them. I also am extremely grateful for everything they are doing for me right now, and I am just taking advantage of them by continuing to use when I am supposed to be getting sober. I do not even really understand why I keep choosing to do it. I have only admitted this to my ex, who is still a really good friend of mine, but the constantly lying to my family is really eating me up inside. I do not know how to be honest with them about what I have been doing, and because of that I keep using to avoid thinking about it or feeling all this guilt. I have felt for awhile now that I am just not a very good person, because of the choices I make through out addiction. But I feel like I am getting worse and worse every day, to the point where I do not even know who I am anymore or how to start trying to be better. One of the things that breaks my heart the most is that I know my mom either knows I am using still, or at least is noticing that something is not right with me. But she will not outright say it. Anytime she is called me out for it in the past I have lashed out on her. I say awful things, put the blame on her or anything else besides me, or I just become completely defensive and end up leaving / cutting off communication with her. I feel so awful for doing this to her. And everyone else in my life. I have lost and pushed away so many people in my life because I chose to keep using and what it is turned me into. Tomorrow, I am supposed to be 1 month sober. I know that my moms going to praise me for it because it is been almost a year since I have been a month sober (when I went to rehab). Most I have been able to stay sober since then is just under 2 weeks. I do not really know the overall point of this ran, and I am sorry if this is not the right place to post this.

If you are not ready yet, you still might have more messes to deal with and things will likely get worse for you before they get better. You are not a bad person, and you need to be willing to forgive yourself. You deserve love and happiness. But it will take work and time to pry those things from the chemicals that are trying to take over your life. Good luck."

Cannot you try groups and therapy, if rehab is out of question? I never went to rehab or NA, but my therapist totally coached me out of addiction. You have a great heart, just by reading about your dog I melted. It takes a lot of love to care more about your dog and your mom than yourself. It is big what you are doing. Maybe change perspective a bit: you have a family that can help you, you have a home, you want to quit\u2026 Try looking around and appreciating the great things you have right now\u2026 And how coke can ruin all of it. That is the exercise I do every time I feel that weird tingle to go buy a bag and destroy my life again\u2026 I meditate a bit about how my life got so much better coke-free, I give a big thanks to the Universe and reset my mood. But I did not learn this trick overnight, it took a lot of practice. Give your big dog and your mom a big hug and reset your mood. Get some ice cream, watch a fun old movie and try to feel how wonderful life can be\u2026 Hold on to that feeling and try to go from there. Be patient. And do not give up. Best wishes"

        "completion": "He is probably part way through a bag and smoking till its gone; its damn near impossible to put the pipe down once started on a small bag. Most do not want to leave a pointless tiny amount; only when its enough to get high again does it get saved. The exception being keeping the shit around all the time and having more already available. I would guess that hes probably still awake from the previous day (at least), unless he is a pretty frequent/daily smoker (when uses on a regular basis the stay up is not for even a day, unless used continuously) its like a day n a half stay up per smoke session typically; also implies putting it down and it stays down till he is come down. However many will just continually load more till is basically gone, which is not hard to do even when trying not to; after the first its hard to not want to just keep going/get higher. So, my guess is he has some crystal left that he has not finished yet, or he is just fished his stash and this came up and is now panicking about the idea of never getting to blast off again/having to throw away the shit he already paid the money for. Pretty sure he just does not like the smell of cigarettes and wants you to stop for his own selfish benefit. I do not really see him stopping, it was obviously no part of his plans when he suggested you quit; indicates a selfish thought process. He accidentally backed himself into a corner by asking you to stop something without thinking he would be asked the same in return. I hope all that was just a high on meth half baked thought/response, but I would not hold your breath. Meth can be a difficult one to handle, especially not knowing how much/often/long he is been using it; could have been a lapse in judgement he feels bad about or he might be ready to double down on the shit he said. I wish you good luck, be safe, and always choose YOURself first in matters of YOUR life. This shits to short to waste it on trying to fix or change the shit we cannot."

He Managed to hold a job, maintain relationships etc. He was on methadone for quite some time. Not sure how long. Recently, I have noticed and so have my family, that he has become withdrawn and isolated. Has lost his job and deflects any attempt to enquire how he is doing. And then recently he asked for money. I do not want to enable him, I also do not want to assume the worst either. Maybe it is something else. But i am worried. How can I help him best in this situation. Thanks.",

But if they did, I would hope they would level with me and try to get to the bottom of it. Heroin addiction is possibly the worst way to try to live. The drug addict in him may fight you when questioned, but deep down he would probably appreciate the help. Its a terrible spot to be in."

I just found something out that is weighing on me terribly out my dad. He (61M) recently had a massive stroke\u2014the majority of the damage was on his left brain. I am trying to stay hopeful about it but the doctors do not give me much hope. My dad was my families main provider, which consists of just me (24F), my mom (60F), and the dogs. I am trying to figure financials out right now and make sure we do not lose the house he worked his ass off for. My mom is beside herself so I am trying to do everything I can to help. This whole thing unraveled when I was trying to figure out where he rolled his 401k over to. He had changed jobs at the beginning of last year and I knew that this company did not offer a 401k, so it had to have gone somewhere. I was scrolling through his bank statements and saw that he was withdrawing quite a bit of money at these two addresses that I ended up googling. Well, he was gambling again. It looked like he had started going to the two casinos nearby and playing FanDuel and what not in June of last year. When I was younger, he had a really bad gambling addiction. To the point of almost losing everything. My parents almost separated but things worked out, we have grown a lot as a family in the past ten years. He had worked so hard on himself to get better. He would gotten on some medication that really helped\u2014he has been severely depressed his entire life. I snooped too far into his phone and found that he downloaded BetterHelp in August of 2022. He was suicidal and looking for help with his gambling addiction. My dad\u2019s addiction is something I hold a lot of guilt for because I know I should have talked to him about it. I am literally in graduate school, becoming a social worker. About a year or two ago, he and my mom had started going to casinos together again. They both knew I was not comfortable with the idea, I told them that he had an addiction like anything else\u2014you do not do them at all, not even in moderation. They did not take it seriously. I know my mom did not, even when I told her that I saw my dad playing an online casino game on his phone back in the beginning of January. She just said that he was making less with his new job\u2014I know see from his bank statement he was actually making more. I should have confronted him. I wish I told him it was okay to talk to me, that I would have helped him. There is so many things I wish I could go back and change :( I am afraid to tell my mom the extent of his addiction. I am also afraid to look further. I found where he rolled his 401k over to, I am hoping to god the full amount is there. I have to get guardianship of my dad before I can have access to it. I am so lost right now and I cannot stop thinking about my poor father struggling in silence. I will never be able to talk to the man that he used to be.",

        "completion": "First of all, I am GOTDAMN PROUD of you for seeking help to change. We actually need you. You cannot comprehend the positive impact your changing will have on the world, especially the impact it will have on those closest to you. If I were you, here is what I would do. Reset your dopamine system- Immediately when you wake up, and I mean right when you open your eyes, get out of bed and do some exercise. Even if it is just 3 push-ups. Any exercise will mobilize your body's epinephrine and give you some momentum. If you find it hard to stop using Ritalin to just get out of bed, make sure you keep your Ritalin on the far side of the room so its easier for your future self to make a better choice. Get into the shower. Make it warm and cozy at first if you must, but then make it as cold as you can stand. Even turn the water on or off, or only put part of your body in at a time. COLD WATER IMMERSION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE THING YOU CAN DO TO ELICIT A SUSTAINED DOPAMINE RELEASE. There are many supplements you can use to help you wean off of Ritalin. L-Tyrosine Phenylethylamine One I cannot recommend to everyone, but Modafinil will release a fair amount of dopamine, though perhaps not as much as Ritalin. It is something to look into. Get your sleep right- -Magnesium Threonate or Glycinate: 200-400mg 2-3 hours before sleep. ... -Theanine: 200-400mg. ... -Apigenin: 50mg. ... -Glycine: 2 grams (every 3rd or 4th night) -GABA: 100 mg (every 3rd or 4th night) Get sunlight in your eyes first thing in the morning, while the Sun is still low against the horizon. Avoid artificial light between 10pm and 4am. A few resources- Dopamine-  The book \"Dopamine Nation\" by Anna Lembke Sleep-  \"Why We Sleep\" by Matthew Walker I will leave it there for now.

I moved across the country to be with my now, husband. At the time he was somebody I talked to on and off for years, and I knew he would be willing to take me in in a heartbeat if I was willing to quit the shit. I am sure you have heard this before, but she has to want it on her own. One day she will get fed up, maybe.. hopefully, but do not count on it. Depending on her situation she may never want help, so I do not want to give you false hope. But for now, you need to put yourself first. Let this run its course, and whatever happens, happens. Maybe one day she will allow you to help her and she will need you, but for now keep your heart safe, distance yourself a bit, and wait it out. That Is really all you can do. Also, there is probably multiple reasons for lying. Its hard to admit to yourself how bad it really is, and being completely honest and upfront about what is going on is not something addicts want to do, because that would mean they have to also admit it to themselves, and then face their issues. They go through life in a thinly veiled haze, numbing themselves and their problems and will never admit to how bad it is until they either get a reality check or hit \"rock bottom\", and sometimes it does not even have to be a typical rock bottom, some are like me and realize this is only going to get worse and I just wanted to be happy again. I am rambling now, but my heart goes out to you. Its not easy to love an addict. Also, when you have been an addict for so long, the idea of getting sober seems scarier and scarier. Humans are naturally scared of the unknown and getting sober means re learning everything they know, which means getting to know themselves all over again and learning how to live and function in a normal society. That can be terrifying."

However, a chemical imbalance in the brain is not really curable, but it is treatable. I have both anxiety and depression, I have had anxiety since childhood and depression started suddenly after puberty. Never got medically treated for it til I could as an adult, and I will say the road is not easy. I have had good years and bad years, times where the meds did not work and times where I could take one for a few years until it stopped working. I will say I have journaled and kept track of what triggers me, and try to change it if possible. Tried therapy but I stopped before I got far because it cost extra that I do not have. Starting a work out routine or just walking about every day has helped, I got a personal coach on Future (an app) and I can do it at home. I have tried to make sure I do a personal care routine or at least do things that make me feel pampered (hot bath with a bath bomb and wine, using my foot massage tub, paint nails, ask for a massage from SO, etc). Hobbies can help as well, but truth need be told it is hard to stick to one sometimes. I am in a depressed funk right now, but it is because I had a baby. I knew I was prone to PPD and PPA, so I never went off my meds and it is helped better than my first one, but it is a circumstance I knew would trigger me and I am doing my best to manage it, as an example. I say once you find what helps you/hurts you, then you can truly start healing. It is not fair sometimes to think we need meds to feel normal, but at the same time is much better than suffering and you are managing your health for yourself. I do not think the economy and whatever else in society is helping, I feel it too and I have stepped away from news sources because it can truly feel doom and gloom and that will not help. Also, make sure you keep up your vitamins in winter because seasonal depression is too. Sorry it was long, but I do hope you know you are not alone and hopefully I have helped.

But when I started getting higher self esteem, I found out that there were other ways of dealing with this stuff. It does not help you. All it does is decrease your self esteem, so it is easier to justify why you do bad stuff, when you can simply say it is because you are an asshole. It is just not so black and white. Believe me, you can get through it, because I did. And if I did then anyone can"

I do not know why I am this way. I do not know anybody else who is such a crazy addict. It is my defing trait and everybody knows it. Anything I like I get addicted to it.i went to the strip club once than went two more times that month, I popped a pill last month and then went on a binge for weeks, I relapsed watching porn this week and watched it 4 times today, a girl showed some interest in me and I went home with her even though I am in a relationship because I am addicted to attention, she ended up being a total psycho and kind of traumatized me with certain behavior during sex. I am even scared to actually ask you all for advice because improvement seems impossible. My grandfather, grandmother, mom, dad, uncle .. are all alcoholics and have allot of personality flaws. I feel like I am the most aware of how toxic and bad the family is but I still cannot break out. I started using when I was 14 or 15 and quickly went from weed to heroin( not a gateway drug my ass) I quit opiates and benzos a couple years ago but I relapse every 6 months or so.i moved out young which really enabled my addictions because I have been able to do whatever I want since I was 16/17. I pretty much forced my gf to break up with me by disappearing for days. Because she deserves better. She is actually great and if I was more mature I would be gaurenteed to have a good future with her. She loves me and saw I was a straight a student and talented at my hobbies and jobs . But I am just so fucking messy and she cannot handle it anymore. I do bad things but I know they are bad and they eat at me unlike other family members.i have fealt so icky all weekend since I cheated but I had allot of chances to stop. I feel like now that I am single I am about to go down a really bad path. I have no self control at all and I am scared to. I am scared to live a life without all these constant vices and temptations. I do not even know what that would look like or how I could. I mean I cannot even get an hour of sleep if I am not absolutely trashed . Anyways I guess I am just venting I am really upset with myself right now.",
        "completion": "I used to self sabotage like this too. I was drinking from sun up to sun down and doing as much heroin as I could afford. I would disappear for a day or two just to get extra drunk sometimes. I am 3.5 years sober now. If you are not ready to stop everything, maybe try to stop just drinking. Once people start to drink super heavy it seems to take a different, harder toll them then some other addictions. I am only offering this advice up as some harm reduction. Of course my re advice would be get sober, try AA."

My brother uses melatonin to help him sleep with insomnia. It does not have many side effects but it really depends on the person. I just watch YouTube or Netflix in bed until I get really sleepy and can sleep without thinking easily. I also sometimes just daydream in bed until I feel comfortable or sleepy enough. Weighted blankets and teddy bears have helped me. It is important to feel safe in your bedroom to sleep easily. Also do not worry this is the correct sub"

        "completion": "Stuff like not being allowed in your rooms and that sorta thing, I assume different hospitals have different rules. I also assume this is in the US, and I live in Europe. That food hierarchy sounds very fishy. Usually hospitals should base their meals on nutrients and such. Again, highly questionable but not sure if this is unique to this hospital. But just from reading the first point ABSOLUTELY YES. A nurse at a mental hospital (!) telling a patient to basically kill themselves is highly unprofessional. If the hospital does not actually take any action, that absolutely needs to be reported. The fact that he told you to be quiet means he knows he did something that could get him in trouble. Unfortunately, I think staff (therapists included) treating patients unfairly is not rare. I do think you should still report it. It is ultimately the reason why people often leave such facilities worse than when they entered. My only concern is that no one is actually going to care about any reports made. But by reporting you did everything you could. And if it is possible, please do report this."

There was only at max 10 rooms in that one wing which was all they had. The staff was all wonderful there, except one piece of shit, who was just a total dick and I mentioned it in group the day I was going to leave as I was already about to go just waiting for a ride & the group leader kind of rolled her eyes and had an exhausted demeanor and she said if I had issue with someone to report it to the hospital, also basically do not in group tell group leader as nothing they can do themselves. ANYWAY the guy who was a jerk piece of shit 3 years later it was brought up that multiple women had filed complaints about sexual assault from him after they got out and nothing happened. A woman was suing and 3-5 other women came forward and said they were raped by the guy in middle of the night and he said for one he would kill them and 2 that no one would believe them that is if they were even coherent enough to know what was going on. Of course an entirely different situation, I went to his trial which he asked for an extension to get all the evidence, which was approved. Then any further developments disappeared entirely. Could not find out if anything happened. I feel terrible about not having said anything as I think about what if me filing a complaint was within a time frame where he would have been fired etc etc and those things could have been prevented. I had been at that one 5 separate times over the years and have not been back since that was brought to the attention of the public. I went to a very large one in a large city where of course I was in all male side as a guy & that was fukn terrible. Fist fights everyday and people getting hit with haldol shot.

Then I will see if I am overwhelmed with work, lol. Please follow me I want to keep doing stuff like this for the community THIS IS SO MEANINGFUL TO ME. YOU HAVE NO IDEA. Hey There :) I built an algorithm to help people with mental health. It is pretty cool. I am an anonymous therapist that is tech savvy. I built an algorithm to analyze peoples needs and then compare it to the progress of other people with the same profile. Then it generates meaningful tips that emails people free advice based on what helped other similar people. The recommendations from my algorithm have been helpful to me and to others. So I run it for other people for free (it is a strange hobby I know, but I like to do it). I have to put the data in manually, so I use google forms to collect your info and I enter it manually later. You can fill it out totally anonymously. Fill out this google form and I will enter your data and email a list of 7 online resources that may help you. I can do more, but it is a bit of work. lol Each response is personalized just for you Know that this is not a generic test.

I was lurking a bit and I cannot believe I have never searched for you guys before. I have to say, regardless of what we have to go through on a regular, you all are such wonderful people. Hands down. HUGS If I may, I would like to share the most recent situation that has placed first in the anxieties department for me. So, I have been going through the anxiety ridden attacks and trying to process something very specific that happened recently. Now, I want to talk about it and see if there is anyone who can support me or has had similar situations that they would not mind discussing and how they got through it? The situation, my new living arrangements. I recently moved into a new apartment, and I have started to get a bit more comfortable with the neighbours, however, just recently, and collectively, they all lied to me at once and supported each other and the lie. The lie: my pharmacy was dropping of my prescription and my neighbours told me that the delivery driver went to the wrong address and that the delivery driver told them what it was and how much i owed for my medication. The truth: this exact delivery driver has delivered medication to me many many times at this new location, and even before i moved here to my prior residence. They know me. They did not go to the wrong address. They also never told my neighbours anything about me or my prescription. So, my neighbours were eavesdropping to gain the information that they had, and then confronted me about it. I am aware that they are phishing for the information and maybe they just want to know more about me? I cannot help to go into full anxiety attacks thinking about my neighbours and this recent interaction with them. I do not know how to approach them anymore now. I know I cannot take this situation lightly as it is a trigger for an attack. I know why i get anxiety from it, because they straight out lied instead of straight up asking me. I Am the kind of person who will tell you anything you want to know if you ask nice. I like bonding with people and i get really upset and anxious when I realize i am being played or whatever. Over a long enough time, the anxiety gets too much, that i will just not talk to anyone or even make eye contact. I literally have no idea how to behave around people who are lying to me or trying to hurt me whether it is intentionally or not. I will shut them out completely. If they had asked me what i was getting, i probably would have told them, it is my prescription for my anxiety. And i know i have told them before i have bad anxiety on prior interactions. They seemed like really nice people, but, now, I am not so sure. I even have crucial information for one of them, and i am absolutely frightened to even approach them now to tell them what they need to know after them actually lying to me and even getting support with the lie from some of the other neighbours. I have no idea why they would lie, but the pharmacy and i have already talked and found a wonderful solution so I can have more peace of mind and be at ease when my medication is being delivered to me. So, I am glad that is going to be okay. I know I need to move, but, i just cannot afford it, which adds even more anxiety to my living situation. They give me that feeling like I have to move, that I do not belong here, but, unfortunately for everyone here, I cannot move, well, unless they want to collectively help me save so i can move. I have spent everything to be here. I worked so hard to get this place and be close enough to family and take care of my child. We have had a rough go, and I have some good support in helping me be the best mama I can be, but, no support on things like this, or have I even heard of stuff like this happening with new tenants. It absolutely makes no sense. I also wonder now how much more they have lied to me about. Like, i know my son and i can be loud when we get singing or playing, and I had asked if we are too loud, because I could easily reset up the entire apartment if we were a bother with noise. They always say that we are not loud and that we are okay. Now, i wonder, if we are too much for them. They also have children coming and going from their units, so, it is easier for me to believe them when they say we are not loud. I can always hear them too when I am in certain rooms. When they are too much, we go to another part of the house. I have never complained about these people and have only tried to be nice and comforting to them. They also have their own issues going on based on my observations, and i have never tried to gain this information from them, to me it is personal, and if one day they want to share their stories with me, id listen to them and hear them out. Not so much anymore now after this recent interaction with them. The advice I get from friends is, just ignore them. They will only get worse the more I interact with them. And call the police if they ever actually try to do anything to me. My medication is not even helping me right now after this recent interaction with my neighbours. I was really starting to believe they were nice people, and maybe they have just been misunderstood, but, now, i do not know.... they teamed up against me and lied to me to get more information. Thank you for taking the time to read through this all, if you did, I apologize for the lenhy post, but, it is actually quite short considering how much more I could actually vent and rant on about.

My crisis unfortunately occur quite regularly (once an year or once every 1 and a half year). But since my first crisis I told me friend that I would not give them attention, I would not go out with them, I would avoid social media and texting. I explained everything the best I could, how I felt, how hard it was to keep contact and how it felt like a task/burden during my crisis. That maybe during the crisis I would need their help and it would seem selfish being absent for long periods os time and appear to ask for help without asking about them. But it is what I can offer at the moment, and that when I am out of a crisis I would treat our friendship normally again. Did I lose any friends? Sure, but it is the life, some people cannot deal with this, but a lot of people can... you would be really surprised. I have a lot of friends for my age. 4 friends that I know that would do anything for me, even take me to their home if I end up homeless. With them I can share about the ugliest parts of my depression if I want to... I also told them that it is ok for them to not know what to say or how to help when I tell them the ugly stuff, I go to a psychologist every week and she can help me with that. I just tell them those things when I feel like I need to vent and I am ok with them only answering in the lines of \u201cshit, this is tough. Let me know if I can do something to help.\u201d And I also have other friends that are super ok with me being absent from time to time, and when I am on those periods of non crisis I talk to them by text and even see them occasionally to talk and have fun, and it seems like nothing have changed on our friendship. I am very lucky to have them, but I know that this is due to the fact that I was honest with each one of them and I asked them for comprehension. Some of them just disappeared from my life with time, but I made other friends and those who I kept are really understanding and supportive. So I guess this is a tip for those of you who do not know How to handle friends during your lows. Instead of disappearing without a warning and being embarrassed to contact them later, or making yourself present on their lives and, consequently, being rude or down in your interactions (which makes them not wanting to be your friend on the long run). Be honest and do not be ashamed to ask what you need. It is a disease, and unfortunately it is a chronic one for most of us. So do not apologize for taking care of yourself the best you can, even if you have to disappear from time to time to do that. The right friends will help you with that. Another tip: do not waste your time with acquaintances. You need to have a good relationship with the people that is part of your daily life, like relatives, colleagues, friend of a friend. So be polite and helpful whenever you can. But do not put your energy and mind on those relationships. You already have so little of it. You should use it to the things that are important to you. Do you need to go to a party from a colleague from work or go out to look for s gift to s baby shower for a distant relative? Do you have to call all your relatives on their birthday and go out of your way to do a favor to your friend\u2019s friend that you see sometimes and chat with them socially on those occasions? Hell no, you do not have to do any of that. Saying \u201cno\u201d while being polite it is totally ok, and should be done by everyone, not just us. If the person gets upset because they feel entitled to your time/money/effort, to hell with them. Who cares?

        "prompt": "Tips to Cope with Depression: A Novice's Guide to Self Help - For context I am a 25F in a highly developed city on the west coast. I am currently in a serious relationship but been single for long periods of time and dealt with failed relationships after years of commitment. I grew up in a conservative religious home with neither parents active in the household since the age of 8. I have dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 10-15 years give or take. Here is just a short list of tips and tricks that help me claw myself out of an unannounced spiraling depression episode. Obviously everyone is different but I hope this can help at least one person not sink further into the depression pit. It has taken me years of introspective thought and practicing different behaviors to the point where I think I recognize my triggers and I feel I have some sort of handle on it now to where I can cope. I hope everyone on here gets the help they need and realize that there is hope if you are willing to fight for yourself. I know this post is going to be unbearably long at some parts but I think it is important for me to explain what I do and why I do it so you can hopefully apply it to your lives. 1. Keep a journal: As trivial and silly as it sounds, keeping a journal to unleash all my uninhibited thoughts and feelings helped me immensely throughout my adolescence and adulthood. I had always been the person hesitant to confide in a non-professional (family, friend, coworker etc) to avoid judgement, unsolicited advice, fake sympathy and I feel a lot of people feel the same way. The first big step I took for my depression is writing down a 7 page account of events that I believe lead to a perpetual state of depression. Getting all that information out of my head gave me a huge sense of relief. I never knew I was holding onto so much weight and animosity toward a situation or a specific person until it fell out of me like an emotional waterfall. 2. Cut out toxic relationships/friendships: This was probably one of the hardest steps in my journey and one I heard on a constant basis from countless articles. It is a lot easier said than done but I can wholeheartedly say cutting out specific people in my life that brought nothing but a dissatisfaction has drastically improved my state of being. Sometimes it is hard to tell when someone needs to be cut out but I had to ask myself if I am spending time with this person because I was lonely and bored, or if they genuinely brought me joy and fulfillment. That can be a hard distinction to make but for me it was a gut feeling once I actually thought about it deeper. 3. Get a pet/plant: I know this is not a feasible option for everyone on here but having a furry friend gave me a \"purpose\" and a \"reason\" to get out of bed everyday. If I want to sleep in or pretend I do not exist my cats will not let me because they want to play, give me love and cuddles and I have to make sure their food and water is full. It forces me to get out of bed every morning whether I want to or not. I know dogs and cats may not be doable in every living situation but even something as small as a hamster or fish will force you to stick to a routine, distract you and bring you more joy. This also applies to a plant, which is a more practical option for a majority of people, especially if you do not have the kind of money to take care of an animal. 4. Recognize your signs: What I mean by that is recognize what behavior patterns you fall into that lead you to spiral into a depression episode. A common one for me (and a lot of other people on here) is not taking care of myself such as, oversleeping, not eating for days, not showering, not responding to loved ones for days, cancelling plans, calling sick into work etc. Once I recognized these sequence of behaviors were a result of me not keeping myself in check, I was able to counteract them with other behaviors, which has been one of the hardest things I have had to learn... Which leads me to 5. 5. Changing toxic behavior: Believe me, I know how easy it is to sink deeper and deeper into the pit. I am sure for some of you (like for me) the pit is comfortable at this point and getting yourself sounds more scary and daunting than letting yourself go. Circling back to 3 I have found ways to forcing myself to do things besides lay in bed and pretending to not exist. I now set a routine for myself after work on Monday I meal prep for the entire rest of the week. One, it forces me to do something after work that is out in public (grocery shopping), two, it forces me to do something around the house besides laying around and three, over the years I have actually grown to have fun doing it. I throw on a funny TV show, watch YouTube, listen to audio books or listen to music. That is just one example of something practical and that most everyone can do to force yourself to stay productive. You will spend less money on food as well instead of eating out all the time, and I have a harder time justifying skipping 2-3 days of food to avoid my food from spoiling (I am a penny pincher). 6. Having something to look forward to: A reoccurring theme to me is to keep busy and productive so I do not feel so stagnant and idle. For me I try to constantly have at least 1-3 things planned at any given month (preferably more than 1-3). Of course think of things that YOU are interested in but some examples of things I do are: concerts, local attractions in your area (my area has a zoo, small theme park, farmers markets), camping, conventions, trying now restaurants etc. 7. Bad days will happen: When all of this is said and done, I still have those bad days/weeks. It is just important to realize that they will not last forever, if you are willing to fight fucking hard for better days. It is okay to cry, it is okay to take a break and \"grieve\" so to speak. Circumstances and situations can definitely trigger bad days/weeks, but reverting back to 4 and 5 you need to recognize if it is just a bad day/week or something more. 8. Self-love/Self-care: If any of you are like me this is a tough one, especially if that little voice in your head tells you you are not good enough. After telling yourself that enough times over several years it is hard to convince yourself otherwise. I guess the most important part about this is baby steps so it eventually becomes second nature. Instead of just getting out of bed lifeless and putting on the first thing you see, pick out an outfit that gives you full confidence. Instead of running out the door without doing your hair or makeup, take that extra 10 minutes to build that confidence. Instead of coming straight home after work, treat yourself to a scenic drive or your favorite soft drink at the drive thru. Instead of comparing yourself to other's accomplishments, recognize your own and CELEBRATE them. There is NOTHING wrong with being happy with an accomplishment and celebrating it. 9. Perspective: My best friend struggles with insecurity, anxiety and comparing herself to others around her (as I do and have in the past) and hearing her accounts made me realize that what she was insecure and anxious about were things I had no idea about. I never focused on her physical appearance, I was always proud of her work ethic, her sense of humor, her tenacity etc. but all she saw was failure. It made me realize that the people that care most about you do not see those \"flaws\" that keep you up at night. Another side of Perspective: This may not apply to everyone, but I would say a majority of people were taught a certain standard of living to be deemed \"acceptable\". Whether that was by their parents, religious affiliation, school, social groups etc. With an ideal ingrained in your subconscious in your development years, it can be hard to shake even if you grow up and choose not to take that path. For example: Growing up in a large, religiously affiliated family I always believed that I would graduate high school, meet a husband and start a family together. Once I reached adolescence I realized that was not the choice I wanted to make with my life. For years I dealt with self-loathing and pain, thinking I was not choosing the right path even though staying with the faith is not what I truly wanted. These pre-conceived ideas of success and happiness I was taught at such a young age was not success and happiness to me anymore, and that terrified me but I did not even know it. I had to completely rearrange what happiness meant to me instead of relying on other people around me to define it on my behalf. I had to convince myself that my tattoos and piercings were okay. That drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis is okay in moderation and totally normal. After years of self loathing and self harm I convinced myself that being openly sexual with my partners is biologically normal and acceptable if done with the right intent and people. A lot of these revelations I learned through journaling. I could write dozens of more things that have helped me throughout my 10-15 year journey. I can honestly say (fingers crossed) that every year that I work on myself the happier I am and the less episodes I slip into. I know this post is long enough but everyone on here has to know that none of this is easy. You have to fight for yourself and work on these things every day for long lasting results. You do deserve happiness even if you and everyone around you is telling you otherwise. \u2665",

I am on autopilot at this point. i am high-functioning, with good grades in college. i feel so scared. just utterly terrified of people finding out, but i feel like this is a disease that i finally need to recognize that i have. since no one in my life can know, maybe if i post this i can get some sort of support so that i can feel not alone anymore.",

Its a new year, new month, new beginning. Which means, its a new chance for all of you. All of us. Today's January, 1st. Take a pencil, or a marker, and make a list of things you hated in 2020. Make a list about people who you want to cross over and kick out in 2021. Toxic ones, if you know what I mean. Go outside, breath in, and burn it. Make that the last time, you thought about them. People we left, and people who left us in 2020, are not supposed to be in our lives anymore. I am saying this, because I had to let go some of them, and it hurts, but you can do it too. Find a mirror, and look at yourself. Smile, and say good morning, or good night. Compliment yourself, even if its hard. Even if it feels wrong to you at this moment. Remember, if there would anything you do not like on yourself, you can always change it, relax. Listen to good music, and read books. Write about the things you feel, make post it walls in your room. Hug your siblings, mom, or dad. Boyfriend or girlfriend, best friend. Even, if your pet is the only living being that you trust. Hug yourself. Everything we go through, we go through for a reason,and everything will pass. We all cried ourselves to sleep, and smashed mirrors, glasses with hands. We screamed from the bottom of our lungs, and cursed everything, thinking we are damned for being like this. But recovery is possible and we will be alright. Its a new year, so give yourself a chance. Get a fish, and try to smile as much as you can. Get tattoos, and dye your hair. Find yourself again, because that person is deep inside of you. Flourish. On your own. With the support of people in real life, or over Internet. Everyone is fighting a battle, and there has to be someone who will understand us. Family is always deep down scared of it, but we have each other. Give yourself a chance, because you deserve it. I will make you private Spotify playlist and if you ever want to talk, pm me here, and I will leave you my social media, so you can text me, or call me. I will even drop you motivational quotes every day you wake up. I will try to help you, and give you reasons to live, and love this life, if you ever lack reasons.

I mean this sort of friends wich wants to go to the next party with you. Friends wich rip you out of your own little miserable life and make a better life even possible. I want a girlfriend which understands me and helps me with my life. Someone who loves me for who I am with all my flaws and everything I would be capable to give her... But who am I to demand something like this... &x200B; But still, thanks. love, also random 21 year old boy"

        "prompt": "Why therapies are not fully benefitial: - based on a conversation with my therapist; therapists only \"guide\" you to solving your problems they do not explain details to you for comprehending your problems better. instead they give you hints to encourage you to discover and understand your problems yourself in my example, my therapist had given me multiple hints about what my problem is by \"hint\" i mean vague statements that sound like poetic inspirational quotes so i did all of us the favor of arguing why they should explain things more directly and comprehensively her answer was that when given straight facts, i will tend to disagree and ignore there are two reasons that result in this reaction first: if we believe in something wrong we should be given actual reasonable argument to change our mind in my example my therapist did not support their \"vague advices\" with any reasoning, they just threw the unclear hint at me and changed topics second: even if we are given clear information supported by reasons there is a good chance we will be too stubborn to consider the information that is opposite of what we believe considering the opposite information is basically trying to understand the reasons behind the opposite information and comparing them to the pre existing one again this act of reconsideration is unlikely from clients because we are too stubborn. so my next argument was that they should help this process by doing all the thinking for us and presenting us all the reasons supporting their final deduction (which is the vague advice) she disagreed, because some of the supporting reasonings can only be \"FELT\" and not explained. so to illustrate the approach of my therapist > 1. give useless hints > 2. inspire and determine us to observe a certain emotion > 3. give more useless hints > 4. wait for us to understand that part of the reasoning that can only be felt, not explained > 5. then give us the rest of the reasoning > 6. again give us the hint to the final deduction > 7. wait for us to connect the lines from reasons to conclusion on our own > 8. now we understand our problem, without stubbornness stopping us now what can we do? we must be too smart to not reconsider opposing beliefs, so whenever the therapist tells us something we should again be too smart to not consider the possibility that they might be right. (also its really shameful to be wrong and stubborn at the same time, instead we should be open minded eventhough wrong) once we are less stubborn we should encourage our therapists to elaborate on their \"vague informations\" by \"asking\" and keep repeating until they have explained the reasons behind deep enough then all that will be left is the part of the reasoning that cannot be explained but should be felt and understood on one's self. then we can easily draw the lines to the conclusion with alot more efficiency and pride than a guy who is so wrong yet so stubborn to consider his problems THANKS FOR NOT READING.

        "completion": "I read your post, and my first thought is that it might help to shop around for a therapist that you actually like. I have seen over a dozen in the past 35 years and i can say that, like with anything else, there is a very wide gamut. For example, I once had a new therapist that I asked, \"What do you think I should do\", and her answer was, \"Why are you giving me all the power.\" I walked out thinking it was weird, but I went back once more. By the end of the second visit I decided she was not for me. So I left and tried someone else. I have also had some great experiences. One therapist I saw once a week for over a year, that is what...50-60 sessions? I liked her the way she communicated, and I grew a ton through the work I did with her. Therapists are just people, each with their own quirks, strenhs, weaknesses, etc. You really do have to shop around and it takes time. I will make a list of 5-6 options and call each one of them. They take a bit to call you back but eventually you get 5 minutes or so on the phone to see how they feel. This has worked for me well. And go easy on this process. Anyone seeking therapy is usually suffering to some degree, and its normal to feel impatient at the beginning. Regarding your reddit comment. It is clear that your passionate about this based off how much you wrote, but most folks will not read a post this long. I bet you would get more replies if you condensed it into one short paragraph instead. Just my two cents though..."

It can be very exhausting for anyone on the outside who is trying to help because it can all too easily seem like your not making a dent at all, and for some you may not be. A co-worker of mine ended up becoming a very good friend and she has her own mental health issues she struggles with. One day I had my attitude drop to the floor and she instantly noticed, she then went on break, bought me a joint and a little snack, came back and sent me on my lunch. I clocked out went into the bathroom and cried for about 10 minutes because I could not believe someone had done something so nice for me, it had been so long. It had nothing to do with the items she gave me and had everything to do with the fact that she cared. She cared enough to at least try and make me happy and that meant everything to me. It is not that my family has never tried these things but my family is also fed up with my downs. I get that constantly trying to do this is very exhausting and I personally do not feel you ever need to go above and beyond but those little gestures here and there speak volumes. I hope I helped in some way even if only a tiny bit, I appreciate you and the efforts you make for your loved one, I wish you the best and good luck."

Constant violence, fighting, yelling and neglect, with police constantly showing up at the house. My family never fed me, and I basically had to beg friends for food. At 13, I started using drugs because I was finally accepted by my friend group. I was constantly high, and everyone in school warned people to stay away from me.

With that out of the way, the best way you can support her is the same way you would support anyone else with love, care, kindness, empathy, and a lot of patience. Myself and my partner both live with depression. We are both on meds. And we both handle our highs and lows very differently. There are going to be times when she shuts off and there are going to be times where everything about her is completely open. If you can roll with it you will be great. Just let her know you are there for her if she needs it. Being with someone who lives with depression is not always easy and it is not always difficult. But that is pretty much just life.

I tried to commit suicide last February but I called my best friend just before I passed out from taking about 20 zolpidem. My parents got an ambulance and to the emergency in time. In the last 17 months I have grown a lot, not because I really wanted to live or anything, I just got sick of feeling this way and thought, I am going to give this one more big heave ho. I got better, I learnt things. Like, my depression is cyclical: no matter how much I improve it will come back and kick me in the guts. So, sometimes I really just have to wait it out and cry and hide and do whatever it is to wait for it to pass. I learnt about more of my triggers, and I developed skills to cope. I spent money and time to sort out my migraines; I picked up crochet to have something to pour my feelings into. I developed tensodonytis from all the crocheting, and I spent more money and time fixing that, ending up with an expensive day surgery and I have not been able to crochet since Nov/Dec 2020. I moved. Started to walk my dog every morning, taught my other dog how to pee in a tray coz he is too afraid to go out. Today, I have been really depressed for 2 weeks and it is getting worse. The worse part is, my boyfriend is the one who triggered this round of depression, simply because he could not be kind to me. He told me to get my brain fixed so I would stop blaming him for all my problems. The sad part is, he was also the one to push me past my breaking point when I tried to commit suicide the last time. He did not come see me in the hospital. I was the one to reach out to him after I would been home a few days. We have been together 3 years give or take. I want to believe in the good times we have had together. The times when he smiles at me and everything is right in the world. When he confides in me and I lend him strenh. And he tells me that he is IN love with me and that I am the love of his life. But I am too afraid to feels the good things because we usually end up in some fight or another soon after. I wonder if I am not kind enough to him. If I am the one pushing him to say these terrible things to me. I wonder if I am better off without him.

        "completion": "I would normally say it is a lost because, dump him. But if you really want to make it work, and he is willing to put in the effort, I suggest couple\u2019s therapy. You can explain to him and the therapist that what he said and did is unexceptible and harmful. The therapist will back you up, because from an unbiased third party opinion, your boyfriend does not seem to want the relationship anymore. A relationship is a joint effort, and he is not doing his part. He should also definitely apologize for hurting you, because that is a bad thing to do. Driving someone to suicide and then not checking on them to see if they survived after the fact is not something you do to a person you love. It is objectively wrong, and there is no viable reason to do that to someone, especially if you truly love them. Your boyfriend needs therapy. If he is unwilling to go, then you should not put up with him. He is clearly made up his mind, and he is not just going to magically improve. I wish you the best. I am sorry crocheting did not work out. Maybe you could find something else crafty to occupy your time. Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 is an under-appreciated and not physically demanding hobby that you could find some joy in. It is also not super expensive if you know how to make your own material. There is also the Sims, which is largely point-and-click, and you can build extravagant houses and decorate them however you want. You can also make your character do other hobbies, such as frog hunting, rock excavating, and botany (in Sims 4). There are a lot of things you can do in the game with expansions, but these four are all available in the base game."

He is 7 years younger then me and just turned 12 which is around when my mental health severely turned for the worse. I think we have a lot of things stacked against our mental health both genetically and just environment we have grown up in. Our mom died when he was 8 and I was 15 (she was sick for 4 years) and our dad is pretty fucking toxic. Living with him through quarantine had me so close to yeeting myself. At some point he decided me trying to take care of my brothers well-being was a threat to his authority but he barely steps in to take care of him so. He also basically isolated my brother from my moms side of the family (+his side lives far) and has yelled at me in the past for taking my brother to see my grandma.. he has not out right said it but I think he sees her as an enemy. Which sucks because growing up she was my best friend and my brother never really got to be close to her. I am not even close to my brother at all, even before I moved out last year, he fusses whenever someone interrupts him just being in his room alone on the computer and my dad would scream at me if I were to try to get him to do anything. And if I do not talk to him he will not talk to me for weeks Until something comes up I guess. At this point I do not know if I am just like paranoid but I am scared of him falling down a dark path. I really do not know what to do to prevent?? Like were not even close so would I even know. I could advocate for him to go to therapy but I do not know how to advocate that without exposing myself?? Which I have considered doing so but my dads a narcissist and it will probably end up being used against me\u2026 : / I should have done this long ago because now I am moving back and it makes it a hundred times worse as I will have to deal with things in live time.

So when you know what you want to make, do whatever you need to do to make it. When you do not know what to make, make anything. Keep making stuff, any stuff, just keep your mind dreaming and your hands busy. Elaboration: Do not make depression your personality. That Is part of what makes it hard to climb out of: you do not know who you are without depression. It infuses everything, who you hang out with, what you wear, what you watch, it seems like who you are. So whatever your mental state, even when nothing seems very fun, Make stuff. For as long as you can, however you can. Make stuff! What stuff does not matter. Follow pretty whims. Follow good memories. Follow an aesthetic. Literally part of what has been reviving me lately is altering my clothing and taking hand-me-downs and finding cheap thrift items and random junk I find to create what my ideal aesthetic without depression might be. More ruffles, more pink, more soft sweaters. There is still some black and some skeleton unicorns and army jackets, But the mean sarcastic t-shirts that no longer represent who I want to be, The stuff i kept because they were gifts but just make me guilty, The stuff that was holding me back is gone, and I am building the stuff a future, healthier, version of myself might like. Or she will make new stuff. Does not matter. Easy come easy go.

        "prompt": "Misdiagnosed with ADHD. Currently doing better on depression medication. - Wanted to put this post up here as a cautionary tale. Cautionary not in the sense that I blame my doctors for a \"misdiagnosis.\" But actually I believe they would be supportive of this as they did mention at the start of treatment that ADHD medications could make a mood disorder worse and were quite cautious for that reason. My background is that I began experiencing symptoms of fatigue and difficulty concentrating many (10+) years ago. I began aggressively self medicating those feelings of tiredness away with lots of coffee. Eventually, I added alcohol too in order to \"undo\" the stimulation from the coffee. When I finally decided that I needed to get to the bottom of things, I received a diagnosis of ADHD. Long story short, the stimulant meds did not help at all. In fact, they basically replicated the effect I was getting from coffee but on a more extreme level. I felt stressed out, incredibly anxious. And after a while, even the energy boost stopped working and I just went back to being tired. Ie, I was worse than when I started. I still could not focused. I was exhausted. And my anxiety was at its worst point yet. Unfortunately they also made me really depressed - as in to the point at which I began having daily suicidal ideation when the meds wore off. My doctor put me on an SSRI but insisted that I still needed ADHD medication. Bad idea. With the SSRI, I finally started feeling better. But when we added back in the ADHD med (Vyvanse) all the progress was undone and I went back to feeling like an anxious and unfocused wreck. Thankfully it prevented the worst of the depression from breaking though. But not all the other side effects. I am now - at my insistence - taking just an SSRI (Lexapro). While I am currently feeling pretty fatigued, so far, I have made more progress in getting my focus back on this than any of the medications. I am finishing books and TV shows and making my way through a Udemy course - all things I found myself unable to do in my unmedicated state and while on Vyvanse etc. My assumption is that the concentration and energy problems are all anxiety and depression related. Obviously I am far from fixed. I will need to continue to see my doctor at 6 week intervals and my diagnosis may be changed in the future. But so far what I am getting from him is that the ADHD may have been the incorrect diagnosis and all my problems could stem from plain old (unexotic) anxiety and depression issues. Morale of the story: if you have been given a diagnosis of ADHD but find the medications are making things worse, it is certainly worth asking your doctor whether you have the correct diagnosis and treatment plan.",

Often feels like it is kind of pointless (although I know that is hiding the real fact that I am anxious about it) Now I try to ensure there is always a real reason to go out every day - however small it is. Concrete tasks to focus on really help me. It could be picking up a particular grocery item for dinner; dropping off a bag of donations; finishing the next chapter of my audiobook. I started selling stuff on eBay so I have to go to the post office a lot. Basically if I get outside every day then it does not feel so scary to do it again the next day, and the next.

There are weeks where I can not manage to take a shower or do the dishes or well, eat due to physical symptoms of anxiety, so leaving the house is out of the question. I missed my last doc appointment because I simply did not have the energy to deal with the panic attacks while I need to be coherent.

And my doc called me back the next day prescribing me a mega-dose of Vitamin D once weekly and daily sunning sessions where I need to go out and sit in the sun every day for an hour (being mindful of sunburns). This may or may not work depending on the time of year and how far north you live, but my physician told me that shutting myself inside for so long contributed to my depression symptoms too, and that my critically low vitamin D levels may contribute to my suffering. Alternatively, most people around the globe who do not work outdoors for a living are at least somewhat vitamin D deficient and it is impossible to get all your vitamin D from your diet. So, though it will not cure everything, I have found that sitting in the sun for a little bit (about an hour each day-my skin is\u2026.transparent\u2026.should have been a warning sign) your body turns a certain type of cholesterol into vitamin D and can also boost your mood with UVB radiation.

I am grateful some days and some days i wish i had died. most days, i do not have strong feelings about it either way. what I have learned about depression through years of witnessing it is this - we are not our minds. the mind is like a tape recorder or movie constantly showing us \"who we are\" but really, we are the one witnessing the movie (the thoughts, feelings of our body). we are not the feelings or thoughts. we cannot control the feelings or thoughts. they just come at us and we are the ones that have to witness them and deal with them. when they hit us super hard, we cannot handle them and want to escape them. when they are not hitting us hard, we want to avoid ever dealing with them again. our mind acts like a computer to come up with solutions. since it cannot solve feelings and thoughts from happening, it is always uses death as this shortcut solution. suicde is ambition for change when our limited history-based minds cannot see any other possibilities. but we can never see the future. we only see what we imagine the future to be based on the past. thoughts and thinking are only good for preparing us to get from point a to point b. if we try to use thinking to \"solve\" our emotions, the best it can come up with is \"you are here so try going there\". people just keep running from point a to point b and back again trying to avoid having difficult emotions. they get exhausted from all this running around and think \"nothing works. i cannot shake theses awful feelings\". boom. depression. we cannot control our feelings or our thoughts. all we can do is try to respond to them calmly. feelings are the body's way of pointing us to a need. some of these needs are physical, like food, physical comfort, etc. some are emotional like connecting to other people (as the last lines in your post seem to indicate), feeling valid, feeling worthy, feeling useful, feeling seen and heard. feelings can also arise strongly when our boundaries are being pushed. i do not want to write a whole book here but the big picture is life is always either the best moment of your life or the worst moment of your life because with every step we take, we carry all the previous moments with us. we never get free from that but we can learn to forgive ourselves for what we cannot control, to forgive ourselves for what we have done and what was done to us. as we develop the ability to forgive by being able to face our terrifying past with stillness and calm, the moments of our past get lighter so we can witness right now with less weight and less clouded vision. i should say people do not often understand what forgiveness is. to me, it is not absolving anyone from responsibility or condoning the actions. forgiveness is accepting what happened because whatever happened did so because someone was acting from insecurity - insecurity causes people to try and control, manipulate, hurt or steal. insecurity spreads like a virus when it touches someone else. forgiveness is the attempt to say \"i will not continue to spread the insecurity that was placed on me\". one last thing to consider is stress. we cannot avoid stress because we are under pressure all the time. gravity holds us down. our lungs and heart have constant pressure. stress is all the time but if you think about how \"fun\" happens, it only happens when we voluntarily participate in doing stressful things. if we always feel a victim to stress, we never enjoy it. when we do things knowing they will be stressful but voluntarily participate, we actually find benefits. you might be going through a lot of stress right now so it is important to figure out how what stress you are voluntarily taking on and what stress you are convincing yourself to do involuntarily. unfortunately, since you are still under age, you will have to deal with lots of forced stress. it is not permanent though. and getting a job is not going to be the same kind of stress you are dealing with now because work brings purpose, not just stress. you do not have to become your parents, even though their influence is a part of you. you do not have to have it all figured out at any age. i still do not have it all figured out. I have had more jobs and more relationships than anyone i know but i keep getting better at saying no to stress i do not want and yes to stress i do. that to me is what getting better looks like. best of luck if you made it all the way through these ramblings. I am always here if you need more clarification."

Judgement does not help me Hi I am new here, I came to this subreddit hoping to have an honest dialogue and receive some advice on how to start tackling some of the issues my depression has created for me. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorders, and cleaning is really hard for me to start with. Like with most people, it is easier when you do not let the mess build up but that is not always possible for me. I moved into an apartment with my boyfriend and a roommate about a year ago. At first, the apartment was not perfectly clean, but tolerable. The living spaces were not unbearable to be in. But, over time a pattern appeared where me and my boyfriend would clean (which is much easier for me when he initiates and I mirror him) and then our roommate would make a huge mess a few days afterward, and I mean huge. She has depression as well (I believe), and does not always clean up right away. I do the same thing. But she would leave shattered plates on the floor, spilled spice shakers on the counter, milk and apple juice with the lids off out of the fridge, piles of dirty dishes in the sink, the list goes on. It was very, very bad. With it already being a huge obstacle to get myself to clean in the first place, I have been extremely discouraged when it comes to keeping things even remotely tidy. I lost all motivation to clean, knowing my efforts would be completely futile come a few days later. So I sort of retreated to my room in the apartment and made it a safe haven (bug-free, dish-free, smells fine, etc). My room still gets messy (empty drinks and laundry) but not nearly as unclean as the rest of the house at the hands of my roommate. This went on for months and the communal areas (kitchen, bathroom, living room) got worse and worse. It is very bad now, like to the point where when I come in the house it reeks and I cannot even bear to look around, I just make a straight line for my room. The good news it she moved about a couple weeks ago, but the bad news is she left her mess behind. One important thing to note is I am in an area where we do not have garbage pick up, so the garbage builds up fast if we do not either illegally dump it in someone is dumpster or pay $35 dollars a dump to take it to the garbage outlet (more on this later) then we have bags on bags on bags of stinking hot garbage. The kitchen is filled with garbage bags, it reeks, dirty dishes have filled the sink for god knows how long, and I literally have not opened the fridge in months. I would not be surprised if there are lots of bugs, mold, and lord knows what else. The living room is filled with junk and all the furniture is moved around since my roommate left hastily with very little respect for our belongings and leaving a bunch of hers behind. The bathroom and her room are in similar disrepair. I cannot even bring myself to begin on cleaning it is so overwhelming and disgusting. But, I literally cannot stand to be locked away in my room any longer and have to look at that mess every time I come home. I just want to be able to actually walk in the kitchen and cook a meal or watch a movie on the couch with my boyfriend. The state of my apartment makes almost every symptom of my depression worse. Cannot leave my room so I sleep all the time. I sleep all the time so my insomnia is terrible and I miss work. The bathroom is disgusting so I cannot even bear to keep my toothbrush in there, much less brush my teeth or shower. I cannot even get to the kitchen, so I eat shit fast food and junk all the time. I cannot keep living like this. I mentioned before that I have no trash pickup. I drive an SUV so me and my boyfriend have been offloading our buildup of trash as often as we have the time/motivation. We have to lay down a tarp in my car so no leakage gets on anything. Obviously, once we have cleaned, we will have to upkeep this. So, now I am going to give you all my major points of struggle and see if anyone can help. Any advice on how to start and how to stop myself from getting completely burnt out/overwhelmed is MUCH NEEDED Anyone who knows anything about deep cleaning like this PLEASE GIVE ME POINTERS Especially on how to get started at all Should I go room by room?

I do not have the energy to take the trash to the dump every 3 days, it is just not sustainable for me.

I will obviously have to take it somewhere once every week or 2 (hopefully 2 so I do not hate my life) but what do I do with it?

        "completion": "After 28 years of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and many drugs, I finally had Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). After 2 weeks I felt improvement and after completing the treatment I feel pretty much in remission. I do not wake up sobbing every day and the world seems neutral now instead of unrelentingly hopeless. I actually enjoy some things. But I still have horrible episodes of what feels like the depression coming back. I am going through some big life changes right now that feel like losses (retirement, milestone birthday, close friends moving away, collapse of spiritual community). So I wonder if this is how normal people feel. My therapist says these episodes are thunderstorms, not like the endless monsoons I used to have. She is right, they seem to be self-limited. But when they are happening I am terrified. So...I woke up crying today just like the old days. I took out the recycling, which helped for a while. I meditated, which did not help. I feel like it would be nice to have other people to \"talk\" to who also live with this. So here I am. Thanks for reading this."

Do a post online for free composting material so you do not have to deal with it? My advice on cleaning is the \u201cpoint and put\u201d method. Just point at something and put it away, either in the trash, where it belongs, or clean it. It is slow but it gets the cleaning buzz going.

Music helps me make sense of what I am feeling. Singing helps me release the heavy feelings trapped within. I have had times when I have felt so alone, so numb, and craved a release. I belt the right song for that moment and I can feel the emotion release. I have a very hard time crying, but in these moments I feel tears build up. That is when I know it is working. It is the same relief I have felt after cutting myself. It is important to let out the pain in a healthy way. Lean into your musical interests. Find the music that helps you feel that relief.

I have cried to myself when none of my family are looking. I do not want to tell my family, because I already got a mentally ill brother and I do not want to burden/worry my parents further. As a young child, I used to locked myself in my room while I had autistic meltdowns, so I was able to control where I directed my anger somewhat. I throw items on the floor like books and then 20 mintues later, I would calm down like nothing happened. When I became a teenager, the meltdowns turns into crying and I would hug myself. I have not hit an item since I was 12, but recently, as my mental health is declining, I have noticed, on rare occasions, I will punch the air or throwing keyrings unconsciously. I am worried my old childhood meltdowns might be returning. I am dealing with an overwhelming amount of intrusive thoughts: I have had suicidal thoughts since I was young teenager: I am not actively planning or or gathering resources, but I sometimes I pass a road bridge and think to myself: \"That is a good way to commit suicide\". I have all this absurd thoughts: \\- I cannot tell where my autism starts and where my personality begins. What are unavoidable symptoms and what are my own chooses? I am tempted to go non-verbal, even though I have been chatty my whole life. It is under the logic: \"If I do not say anything, I will not annoy anyone\". \\- I feel like inherently evil and I will being going to hell if it existed, due to these thoughts in my head. (I am am atheist) I have done never anything illegal in my life. I have never made someone else cry as far as I remember. I am even very protective of animals: Like I rushed out to save a baby pigeon after the tree trimmers cut down it is home. Despite people telling me, to drop the dirty bird or let it wonder off, I could not because I wanted to ensure it was safe. \\- I think I should live alone by myself in an isolate apartment, so I cannot bother anyone. \\- I am scared of ever becoming a mother or a partner, because I think I will be this horrible, emotionally abusive person to live with. \\- I am scared of becoming a criminal and going to prison. For example, if I learnt to drive and accidentally hitting someone with my car. Or I feel like I could hurt those close to me. \\- I refuse to vote, because I feel like I am too stupid and ignorant to make an informed choose and my vote will only add to a harmful leader. \\- I have silly power fantasies: where I imagine myself being prime minster, being a criminal mastermind, the world's greatest movie director, etc.",

I can feed myself and keep myself alive. I cannot hold down a job though, my anxiety is so severe that I get panic attacks when I try to get a job. The whole process gives me anxiety and when I actually commit to the job it gets worse. The societal and social expectations and responsibilities that come with a job weigh on me so heavily I feel like I cannot breathe. It sends me into a panic every time. The last time I held down a job was over two years ago I believe. I check off every requirement for the social security benefits anxiety list. I make $0.00 every month except for the allowance my parents still thankfully help me with, but that is just enough to buy groceries to live off of. I am in desperate need of financial help but I do not have the money to hire an attorney or lawyer to help me file a claim for my benefits.

I am not sure if this is the right channel to put this in but I have been struggling for a while. note: this is not me seeking dx from anyone, I am currently already seeing a psychiatrist for depression and anxiety So for the past month I have been on vacation and have not been able to relax. I am leaving to go back home next week and I still do not feel satisfied enough. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist the day after I get back so I plan on bringing it up. For the last 1.5/2 ish months my brains been going all over the place. Since I have been here I have been planning my future from the next month until 5 years in advance. I live in America for example and I have been going on for ages about how I am going to move countries someday. I have outlined a whole list of goals and everything about how I am going to get there (listed below) and have done extensive research on visas, university post graduate programs, current job openings, apartments, bus fare costs, plane tickets, etc. so here is what I have outlined in my head for a while -firstly I am going to get a new job because my current one is not too fun -secondly I am going to declare a major in international Justice -I am going to study abroad in wales (and possibly move there if I like it) -I am going to graduate college cum laude/apply to the school I study abroad at for a postgrad program And so many more that are unrelated to this Now over the last couple of days/week or so, I feel like I am declining mentally again. I stopped taking my medication (Prozac) for a week since I have been forgetting to take it, combined with the fact that I hate taking it. While on it and pondering my whirlwind of ideas I have had really bad memory problems, trouble concentrating, staying off my phone, etc. it is worth noting that I am also diagnosed with ADHD so my symptoms may be exacerbated because of my medication. I started taking it a couple days ago since my mood was declining in the coming days before I started again. My mood is getting progressively worse especially since I am going back home in a few days and starting school in the next 3 weeks. My sleep has been horrendous over the last few days and thinking about starting school again is making me really depressed. I had all these big plans only for me to completely lose interest in all of them and lose touch with where I am actually headed. I do not know what I want to major in anymore and I do not know if I want to study abroad. I have a feeling I might have just experienced a hypo manic episode and do plan on talking to my psychiatrist about it. But I am just becoming really depressed and impatient about other things which include finding an S/O. I feel like it could be the dating apps that I am on that are causing this and plan on deleting them soon but I was not like this for the last 4-6 months. There was a period in which I went from really depressed to content, then from content to the over planning and everything, to now feeling like I am getting back in a depressive state. I felt ready to conquer the world and set out on my journey but now I feel really lost again. I feel like I am going nuts and I could really use some support and advice on where to go from here. I Do Not Know how much talking to my psych alone is going to help and I feel like I am going crazy here.

        "completion": "First you are not a failure, and you certainly do not screw everything up. You appear to be an introspective person, who communicates well, and who is in touch with their emotions. This is unique in itself. The desire to give yourself to others is a virtue not a vice. Unfortunately we live in a culture that is obsessed with the self. We think that making ourselves \u201chappy\u201d is a proper life goal. I tried that, it does not work for very long. I put myself first always. I sought wealth, power, pleasure and honor. Sometimes I achieved some of this, and it made me happy for only short periods. I found true peace in seeking meaning in life. Someone said that we can spend our entire life asking \u201cwho am I\u201d? But the proper question is \u201cfor whom am I\u201d? You are a truly unique creation. You have all sorts of thoughts, emotions, talents, and charisms that are meant to be shared with those around you. You must care for yourself so that you can develop all of your unique gifts, but then you need to share those gifts, and that often means putting the self last. There was a priest named Maximilian Kolbe who was in a Nazi concentration camp. Prisoners had been selected for execution. He had been spared, but he took the place of a condemned prisoner who was worried about who would care for his family after his death. He put himself last. He willed the destruction of himself to rise above the self and to become truly free. He transcended self. To me that is a hero. His meaning in life was service to others right up to the point of his death. Get to know yourself. Develop all of your gifts to your fullest ability (and believe me, you will discover that you have considerable gifts once you really look). But then share those gifts. You will find the greatest meaning and peace in being of service to others. Life is extremely challenging for ever creature on this planet. By reaching out and helping each other we can find peace and meaning in our existence. May God bless you on your journey."

        "completion": "you do not need to worry. it is funny how many people on here also have anxiety but are clearly freaking you out more. heart palpitations are completely normal. this can manifest in different ways\u2014 you can either feel like your heart is speeding up, skipping a beat, or fluttering and you may feel it in your chest and throat. PACs and PVCs are the little \u201cbeat skips\u201d that you have. PACs are completely benign, and PVCs are also completely benign so long as they represent less than 10% of your heartbeats. it beats about 100,000 times a day, so your heart would need to have 10,000 PVCs for it to be considered \u201cworrisome\u201d. 2 or 3 times a day is nothing. and fun fact, most people will have 1 PVC in a 24 hour holter monitor they are extremely common. the main difference is people with anxiety can feel them more. there is a certain group of people who are hyperaware of their heart. so every time the heart does something a little different from normal, people who are hyper aware feel it intensely. if you are super worried about it, i would go to a cardiologist to calm your nerves. i am not saying you \u201cneed\u201d to go, because you do not. but it is honestly worth the peace of mind. if you have any benzos, maybe take one before you go in if you are freaking out. i also have white coat syndrome and my blood pressure sky rockets the second they put the cuff on my arm. when the doctors freak out about it it makes me freak out more. if you can afford it (only if), i personally prefer the ER. a whopping amount of patients go to the ER with panic symptoms, and those doctors have such a natural way of easing nerves. i went in with blood pressure 150/100 and heart rate over 150 bpm, and they did not even flinch. when i expressed concern they said \u201cthat is not even the highest blood pressure/heart rate we have seen in the last 10 minutes.\u201d anxiety can cause awful symptoms. heart concerns are the leading worry for people with panic attacks. it is okay, you are not dying. there is nothing wrong. what you are experiencing is totally normal. sucky, but normal. wishing you the best mental health"

Read some stuff of your collegue. This should not be a lost day, if you do something for you (chilling or studying) it is not a lost day at all. About your anxiety and the situation of the car, do you go to therapy or something like that? If you do not, I think you should get some professional help so this does not happen anymore. Like you said, you have great grades, you did a great effort studying and attending your classes all by yourself and the results are there, you did great. You just need some help to be more calm about your anxiety and so on, and I think therapy would be a great solution. Once you solve that, you surely do great like you did before! Do Not you think?

Be as affirming as you can Let her know that her depression is not because there is something wrong with her, but that she is feeling all the emotions at once and that is a lot Depression is an invisible disability. By taking it one minute at a time and celebrating the little wins (as tiny as brushing teeth) are really what kept me surviving. You could help her with chores too because for me it was even really hard to eat. She sounds like she is doing everything she can to cope - and she should be so proud that she is able to take care of herself by trying new meds and going to therapy. Be gentle and help her persevere - this is tough for you too Be kind to yourself, and remember to take care of yourself too. Sending you love!"

I know from experience (I also struggle with anxiety and depression and for a time I had anxiety attacks), that it can be harmful to you to keep everything to yourself. If you trust your mother enough, maybe you could tell her what is going on with you. Assuming she does not have a history of the opposite behavior, telling her may keep her from yelling or misunderstanding when you have a panic attack. It may bring you closer together, if you feel comfortable sharing. It is an extremely hard thing to do and not beneficial for everyone, especially given family dynamics so take what I say with a grain of salt.

People also often find me very relatable, since I know how to copy their behavior and basically turn into exactly what they want to make them fall for me, which made me think and that is why I am here right now. I do not like when people ask me for favours or wan\u2019t my support/attention. People who seek my attention make me mad, I just cannot stand it. Everytime one of my friends starts crying in front of me, I do not know how to react or act in general. I just get annoyed and tell them to stop crying. I hate hugging them, even when they ask me and always need distance between my and their body. As soon as they get close to me, I get angry. Once my friend overdosed on pills in front of me, It did not stress me out or made me feel anything besides anger and annoyance. I always knew that she was suicidal, but I just never cared enough to help& I know that this sounds shitty, but I cannot help it. I called an ambulance for her while sticking my fingers down her throat, causing her to throw up since I did not want to be involved in her death. When the paramedics asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital with her, I said no.

I just do not feel any empathy for her and her stupid \u201cmental illness\u201d. It makes me mad how much she talks about it and always needs to mention it to me. After she was gone I sat back down and finished the food we had cooked, cleaned up after myself and went on with my day. Today one of my friends told me that one of his close friends was found dead somewhere. I do not know much about it since I did not ask, but he wanted to talk to me and asked if we could hang out to clear his head a bit. I know that I am supposed to feel bad for him and be there for him, but I do not want to put on a show just to make him feel better since it does not benefit me in any way. I stopped replying and acted like I was not on my phone. I was not sad or grieving when my grandma died unlike my other family members. This happened in 2018 and I still have not cried once over it. I remember when she was in the hospital bed but I did not want to go because it is \u201cboring\u201d and went shopping with my friends instead. The only grave I would cry on is my moms. I would do anything for my mom, but nobody else matters to me. Back when I was at the mental hospital, I often got kicked out of group activities (which I did not like and avoided most of the times anyways) for being too careless about others and triggering the other impatients with my behaviour. For example in art therapy I used to draw very detailed gore pictures (I still make art like that, it is just my artstyle) which of course triggered a lot of the other people there. I got really mad about the fact that they were such crybabies since I never got triggered over anything there. I eventually got kicked out and threw a fit over it since I do not get why I would have to change my art just because some sensetive weirdos need to overreact. I did not care when my best friend got raped, I did not even feel bad for her. I did not care when my dad murdered my stepmom, I even felt slightly happy since I did not like her anyways. I hate people who openly talk about their \u201cmental illness\u201d or sadness. I hate attention seekers. I do not know if I am a bad person, but thinking of it, since it does not affect me most of the time, I would be fine with being an a-hole. But right now my relationship with someone ended, because I was too \u201ccold\u201d for them. I do have to admit that I tend to become really aggressive and loud quickly, as soon as something triggers me and I can be really mean without even realising.

        "completion": "So many things could cause this; trauma, abuse, drugs, genetic disorders, chemical imbalance in your brain, mental disorders, etc. It sounds like you went through a lot of fucked up shit as a child, which permanently affects your brain. Your decision making, emotional regulation, and impulse control, among other things, could be outta wack. You are not selfish, honestly the problem might be that you distance yourself too much from emotions in general, and invalidating your own trauma leads to not caring about other's emotions. You are dealing with a lot of your own shit yet you are expected to act a certain way and put others first when you have not even dealt with your own shit right now. This is honestly all just a guess though. You would have to go to a trained psychologist and therapist (not all of them are good and it might take a couple tries to find a good one), and really open up about all of this, and everything you went through, before you get some proper answers. Strangers on the internet are not too helpful."

The \u201cchemical imbalance\u201d explanation is oversimplified but there are measurable differences in the brains of mentally ill people. If there is something wrong with you, as someone with a degree partially related to psychology, your best bet is to keep talking to professionals until you find one who takes you seriously. There are many people like you who are very selfish and do not care about others who still learn how to be empathetic for selfish reasons, such as if it means keeping the people they like close to them. Also, angry outbursts could count as getting \u201ctriggered,\u201d so just because they do not upset you by making you sad or shocked does not mean you are not dealing with the same thing other people are. I would talk to someone about a cluster B personality disorders (including narcissistic personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder (aka sociopathy), and histrionic personality disorder) if you want a place to start, but please take that with a massive grain of salt because I do am not a fully licensed therapist (yet).

My anxiety and depression kill my appetite and make it very hard to eat anything. So far, I have found it helps to try and keep a consistent meal schedule. Three meals a day, even if those meals are small. Just having a routine is helpful. You do not have to worry too much about healthy food. If junk food is the only thing you can stomach, go with that. Take advantage of any cravings you have. I get nauseous when I eat too, but there are some foods that do not make me feel quite as sick. Try and find what foods those are for you and stock up on them. Try eating a few bites more than you want to at every meal. It is uncomfortable but slowly it grows your appetite and you will be able to eat more food without feeling as sick. Anxiety and depression can stop you from gaining weight. I was having daily anxiety attacks and according to my doctors, I was burning calories because I was so anxious. My heart races when I am anxious to the point that it is basically cardio. I was down to 89 pounds and I was terrified of dropping more weight because I was so unhealthy. Once I started medication for my anxiety (80mg propranolol) my appetite came back and my body could maintain weight. I am also on antidepressants which often because weight gain as a side effect, which for you and I can be extremely positive. I am a healthy weight now and feel much better. I know lots of people have plenty of reservations about taking medication, but if you still cannot gain weight it might be something to look into.

I am still reeling from everything that has happened. My boyfriend has been pushing me away, and last night, he finally told me that the reason is that he feels depressed. I am far away from him currently as I am studying abroad. We have been doing LDR for the past 2 months. He said that he has been feeling this way even before I moved abroad and that me being far away aggravated what he felt. He is in grad school back at home which is a great stressor for him as well. He insisted that we break up as he is too tired to do anything and everything, including showing his love for me. :( He also said he has to get better it on his own. I protested, saying that I will do everything to help him, but he disagreed. He said that it is unfair for me to wait for him to get better when he does not know if he will get better. He even asked me to stop loving him. While he is the love of my life and I only want to be with him, his well-being is more important than our relationship. I accepted what he wanted, telling him that I will always be here. I do not know what to do, guys. My heart is torn and I feel helpless. He even said that he is not sure he is going to accept me if/when he gets better because he is changing and he does not know what is happening to him. :( This is the man I want to spend my life with. I want him to get better. I know that I will continue to be there for him whether or not we are together, but I do not know what to do. Should I avoid talking to him completely or should I ask him every now and then how he is? Should I wait for him to reach out? I want to help him so badly, but he is pushing me away at every turn. I do not know what to do. I want to come home and see him over the break, but I am not sure if that is good for his well-being. I need your help, guys.",
        "completion": "First, how are you holding up? It can be hard when someone close to you is going through a crisis. Make sure to take care of yourself. The best thing your boyfriend can do is to get professional help. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy in combination with medication is the gold standard of treatment and has the highest success rate of any treatment for depression. It is not a magic cure, but most patients find the right medication for them within the first four medications that they try. You may encounter resistance when suggesting that your boyfriend get help. Depression has a way of putting thoughts into a person\u2019s head, and the fact that he is pushing you away means that those thoughts are winning. You need to convince him that he has a real medical problem that deserves real medical treatment. Your presence in your boyfriend\u2019s life is helping him more than you know. If he gets isolated, he may spiral down a depressive path that could potentially cost him everything. Social support is very important to people who suffer from depression, and texts and calls can be a lifeline to someone who is trapped in a depressive episode. Other things that can help him include having him start exercising regularly (it is good for his brain!) and make sure he hangs out with friends. Not to catastrophize, but if your boyfriend ever feels suicidal, make sure he has the number for a suicide hotline or crisis center and for a nearby mental hospital, just in case he needs it."

        "prompt": "I do not know how to stop grieving for the life I could have had without ADHD - I cannot post this in the adhd sub so I apologize in advance, hope this is allowed here. I am feeling horribly alone and depressed about this. I finally got diagnosed in adulthood, and started learning coping skills and taking medication. I thought I had adhd since I was a teen. I was already in treatment for other mental health conditions, but every time I would bring up adhd with a provider, I was dismissed without any further consideration (probably because I, and AFAB person, did not show the textbook male presentation of adhd / was not (externally) hyperactive). Instead, they chose to throw all kinds of anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotics at my symptoms. Those medications never helped me. I grew up thinking I was just less than everyone else - that I was stupid, incapable, lazy, etc.. I watched people around me do everything I wanted to do and more while I fell short, and I never understood why. There is always been SO MUCH I wanted to do, but I did not have the time management skills, nor the focus to learn and participate. After I started treating my adhd, I felt like I actually had some control. I did not feel paralyzed and incapacitated by the simplest tasks. For the first time I was able to really explore my passions - I have always loved drawing, and in my late 20's I have finally. FINALLY. Been able to sit down and learn to draw. I love it so much, it makes me so happy. My art has helped my mental health immensely (although it scares me how hard it still is to draw when I am unmedicated. And heck, how hard it is just to get through the day.) But I do not know how to get over all the time I wasted not learning to do the things I wanted to, and now I am years behind everyone else despite my best efforts. I do not know how to get over the fact that no one believed me when I was suffering. I feel genuinely traumatized by how dismissive they were, especially when I have come to find out how incredibly much adhd medications and coping skills have helped me. I know, I know... all I can do is move forward - there is no use being depressed about the past when you cannot change it. (But, Good God, does it hurt.) And, even though I am more capable now that I am properly being treated for adhd, I still struggle a lot day-to-day. Even trying as hard as I can, I just do not have the mental energy, time management, or executive functioning abilities I would need to pursue all the things I want to do. I do not think I have an unreasonable amount of interests - I would like to pursue my art more & maybe set up an online shop for prints or do commissions, learn to use a simple DJing app (a friend of mine hosts club nights, and I have always loved the idea of Djing), and of course I still have to work and keep up with the demands of my job (such as continuing education). I love yoga and meditation, and I would love to explore fitness. Maybe read an occasional book. But all of this on top of the basic demands of life - making appointments & plans, shopping and cooking for myself, being on time, getting to bed at a reasonable hour, and so on. I have already basically forgone the idea of ever getting back into singing or playing instruments like I used to, even though I loved it. I can barely fathom the idea of going out with friends, or even making more friends (I currently have only very few, almost none of them close.) I am not even sure of how to execute the many artistic ideas I have.. I feel like I am doomed to never be able to live up to my potential, because I have adhd. I am doomed to always have to water down my dreams. I have to live the rest of my life watching myself underachieve. I have to live the rest of my life with the chronic stress and exhaustion of fighting my brain to get through each day. I am stuck in this constant loop of mourning what I could have been; of trying to pick myself up out of the grief and depression this causes me. I am tired and overwhelmed. I hope something, somehow gets better. I know I will never get back the time I lost. But I hope I can somehow get better at managing. Because I do not look forward to living in this ADHD hellhole the rest of my life.",
        "completion": "Those years are gone and feeling sad and angry and frustrated is very valid. Your complaints were being minimized and your concerns were not treated with appropriate respect. I think you have trauma that may be worked through in therapy. I have ADHD and I have noticed that my executive functioning suffers when I am stressed even if I am medicated. I think being able to properly unpack the trauma of losing those productive years and learning CBT or DBT techniques to help cope with anxiety, stress, anger, sadness will help. At least they helped me. You have the right to be angry and you deserve therapy to help you process it and recover."

The annoying part about hospitalizations is that the psychiatrist sees you like once a week or even 2 weeks so they really cannot pinpoint want meds will actually help you. I also went to the kids ward because I was 17 at the time so I am really scared of ending up at the adult ward involuntarily but I also wanted to admit myself not too long ago.

They care enough to physically be with you when discussing something important. 3. By your description, the subject of the conversation is going to likely be serious, but not directly connected to your actions.

How is your hair? Does it need a brush or washing? Do that. Take your time, do it carefully and gently. You have total agency of that. Is it lunchtime? You have full control and agency over that, given, I guess, time and fiscal constraints, so treat yourself if you can. Focus on what makes it so nice, textures, flavours, big portions, etc. Remember back to happy events around that food. Also, I do something I call \"counting my blessings\" when I am anxious.

Later, I will; Meet my mum for tea. Work on my book. Sleep in a soft bed. Talk to a friend about our shared hobby... ...all nice, safe things, and I am feeling more grounded and happy about myself now.

        "completion": "My days go like this many, many times. I also struggle to find motivation to do stuff, even the things I want to do for myself, or my wellbeing. There are a few things that help me get some of this done, even if it is little by little:  To-do lists used to just put me down, because I did not feel the energy to complete any of the tasks. I learned of the SMART way of listing the stuff you have to do, which essentially means, you need to write your tasks in Specific ways, taking into account a way of Measuring whether you completed them or made some progress. They should be Achievable (do not forget to take into account how much you can do in your current situation, be understanding of yourself), no matter how small or big, and Relevant to you or your needs. The T just stands for Time-specific. A SMART goal should look something like >Finish folding laundry before tomorrow (If you did not finish/check one of these tasks, remember that is OK. Most of us just let tasks sit there sometimes; we are not robots who can just decide to finish things that are written on a list. Forgive yourself if this happens, and make the choice to erase some un-done tasks that you feel you will not be able to follow through in the end.)  I cannot stress enough, be understanding. You are better suited than nearly anyone else to understand and see how hard things are for you, so you should also be able to forgive yourself for taking days off, even if you did not mean to take them. If there are weekends such as the one you described, where you think of something you have to do and just go to bed, it is likely the result of being under considerable stress. Something, be it a thought or a feeling, is putting pressure on you, and your body/mind seem to need to space out. When I feel like I watched another day go by, I try to remind myself that yeah, maybe I did not do stuff I wanted to or had to, but it is a symptom that something is off and it might get better if I consciously let myself rest.  Apps such as Habitica have really helped me with this. Setting goals for simple things such as drinking water, taking my meds, taking showers and making my bed remind me, at the end of the day, that it is a privilege that I found the strenh to do something, even if it is just drinking 2 liters of water. Because I know there are days when I cannot even do that. That is an improvement, even if small, right? You do not even need apps or lists to be aware of this; just remembering that today you did more than you thought you did is enough. Sometimes we cannot even get out of bed, so when I do, I sometimes think \"wow I got out of bed and started off a new day today\"  Being diagnosed with depression for a whole 8 years now, I want to remind you that I understand. Many of us understand. The world seems to keep going without us, but we are here, even if a little more silent. I know how hard everything feels. For me, it comes and goes in apparently unexplainable fluctuations, so I have found that cherishing the times when I am doing better is great for my wellbeing. I hope I helped you. My methods are not necessarily bulletproof, but being diagnosed with ADD, having something automating my to-dos and habits is a huge relief for me."

It is like a big scientific experiment - Try something, analyze the results, and if it does not work, take what I have learned from that and try something else.

Then stay with it until it does not work anymore, and from there go back to square one and repeat the process, Right now I am acting once or twice a week at a murder mystery dinner theater. It is not easy, but I do not have time to be depressed when I am interacting with the guests in character, and telling jokes and laughing. In fact, when I am at the theater, or practicing my lines at home, I actually do kick depression's ass. It is no magic fix. I still have my moods and down times.

My depression rooms have been bad before, but never to this level. i am going to be honest and open because i feel safe in the anonymity of reddit. About a year ago my mother spent a week cleaning my whole room of all its trash and it meant everything to me, i kept it clean for a good while but before i knew it it spiralled again (and i am holding a lot of guilt for ruining her hard work). For months now i have cried every night, i have slept in the hallway when it gets too much, it is hard to even push my door open and i have to jump to get onto my bed. Most of it is clothes and trash and lots and lots of soda cans. The only space i have is one part of my bed for my body, it is so bad that the piles of crap on my floor are now taller than my bed. This is so embarassing, i hate myself for it and all i want is a normal room. T/W : Sicide I will not go into detail, but last month i had an attempt. It is been one of many over the years, and it sprouted from hatred towards myself for living in this disgusting room. I do not let my family see inside, just my mother sometimes.

If people press for more info I let them know I appreciate their concern but that I prefer to keep my medical information private and thanks for understanding.

I am only in contact with one of these friends still and they have been reluctant to vouche for me with the other, I started writing a suicide note for them to read but they have all blocked me so the only way I can get it to them is through this friend. Now I will say that one of the people in this group is my ex and the note was mostly meant for her to read and while it started as a suicide note it turned into more of just everything I want to say to, no vitriol or anything just a look into how I feel especially pertaining to how they had treated me, I even wrote it around flower symbolism which is something my ex was very into. I think just by sending this note along it could help me to move on, it could give me some amount of closure that they have refused me over and over. The one problem with that is my friend might just refuse to send the note which would suck a lot for me as I would once again be denied that closure. So what do you all think?

Good emotions are fleeting which yeah is also a problem but any negative emotion is felt at a 10/10 regardless of the because. If I stub my toe or get in an argument or do not have a place to put whatever is in my hands down my brain goes crazy. Any perceived \u201cnegative\u201d whether or not it affects me I snap. My day is ruined I will panic I will hurt myself and I cannot calm myself down. I know it is normal to feel bad sometimes but everything is to the extreme my perception of reality distorts every feeling into life or death. Can this be helped? will I have to cope forever? Do I need to be sedated all the time so I cannot get that intense? Is there anything that makes existence less intense?",
        "completion": "Do you mean pharmacological or behavioral. Literally every mood stabilizer and neuroleptic/antipsychotic drug reduces emotional intensity\u2014lithium, lamotrigine, seroquel, oxycarbozepine, and to some extent antidepressants, although to a much less extent, hence why bipolar people or people with PTSD or borderline personality syndrome are not stable in A/D\u2019s alone. You might say that anxiolytic drugs reduce emotional intensity as well (e.g. clonazapam is used to treat mania or relapses to mania). Many of the anxiolytics are essentially sedatives or tranquilizers (alprazolam, diazepam), but there is a ton of atypical ones that are used off label that are not hugely sedating\u2014clonidine and guanfacine to list a few. Some of the tranquilizers (generally benzodiazepines since older ones like the barbiturates are even more dangerous) are not hugely sedating but will always have some sedating effect since they work to increase gamma-aminobutyric acid, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in your brain. Alcohol also does this and it is why it reduces social anxiety but please do not go down that path. Neuro-Behaviorally it would be along the lines of meditation, breathing exercises, cognitive behavioral therapy (depends to what extent your weddedness to certain fixed beliefs is emotional for you), and other whole body oriented with mindfulness component practices such as martial arts, yoga, and tai chi. I would also suggest that a structured writing practice can diffuse the triggers that nudge you towards excessive emotional intensity. I think this is a part of dialectical behavioral therapy which was invented to treat a borderline personality, a condition notorious for erratic emotional fluctuations of high intensity. I personally use all of these strategies. Pharmacologically I take lithium and clonazapam, methylphenidate and bupropion, but it is questionable how much the latter two address emotional instability and intensity. In theory methylphenidate (aka Ritalin) should but at the same stimulants can induce emotional instability. I follow a structured writing practice that is pragmatically oriented that I use to defang the weight or severity of life situations triggers etc. All that said I still suffer severe fluctuations towards very intensive negative emotions involving rage and suicideality. I actually requested due to this fact because I know where it leads to otherwise. I am in a life situation (2 years foreclosure) that is highly triggering to me and I think the stimulant and antidepressant I use can feed into unstable emotions (methylphenidate/ bupropion). At the same time My blood pressure is pretty high probably due to circumstantial and possibly pharmacological factors (both the Ritalin and the welbutrin can increases blood pressure) so am looking to initiate guanfacine or clonidine to replace them. I was given a single clonidine pill in the doctors office because my blood pressure was critically high and I have never felt calmer in my recent memory. In any case I hope this helps and I wish you all the best. It is a day to day struggle. There are no silver bullets no magical therapies or gurus that have a simple solution for emotional regulation."

Look at the requirements that the job is asking for and what is \"preferred but not required.\" You will not be intending to apply for said job right now at the current moment if there major things you still need like a bachelor's or associates, or a certification/trade license or whatever. But you can reverse engineer goals by seeing what the current job market requires and try comparing similar job listings for other companies and places to get a realistic grasp to get there. You may find that you will not need a bachelor's for \"xyz\" job and it would only require something that is far easier to obtain than trying to force yourself to get through college. Our generations kind of been implanted with the belief that we all have to \"work a job that is our passion\" or \"love what you do and do what you love.\" But some people may never find a job or work that actually fills them with \"joy\" no matter how long they keep trying different things. They might realize that all job work itself is boring af and the only happiness and pleasure they get can be from relationships and personal life things outside or work. And they just have to find a job that is easiest to put up with and has the least tradeoffs while also making sure that job is enough to make a living on in this already economic messed up world. Biowaste Cleanup Crew (cleans dead bodies or dead animals from public areas and in homes etc) can pay a shit ton $50 an hour??, but that can fuck your head permanently seeing normal people turned to bloody unrecognizable messes. Waste management/ trashcan collecting/etc: a reddit post once talked about how you can make decent good money off that. Just have earphones listening to music all day and drive the truck/pick things up quickly and you do not have to put up with people's bullshit like in retail/food jobs. You should check it out I think the post was somewhere in R/askreddit \"what kind of job can an unskilled uneducated person get that can provide a comfortable living for the rest of their life?\" So many good answers. I work in the music education world where most musicians are either regular teachers or are travelling performers doing gigs in random far away places and doing church music work even if you are atheist. Music teachers do not exactly get paid a whole lot but if they have a deep desire and love for working with kids then it is worth it to them. It is also been a common thing that some musicians train getting an education degree and after working in the real thing realize working with kids sucks ass and then change their careers to doing professional music but working only with adults. I was in the same boat with college I took a 3 year gap away from college to take a mental break and work on my depression/ptsd/insomnia health problems so I can be in \"better shape\" when I return to school. I came back and did everything I could have best way I can and it was not enough I just am too depressed and have too many health issues in academic environments where I am the student. I realized that yes I would love to finish this damn degree that I have spent 6 years on already because I know I will have less of a hard time in the future getting decent jobs with this qualification. But I cannot spend another 2 or 3 years in college, no amount of extended deadlines or accommodations helps me and I had to decide to drop out of college permanently for my own health. I feel a huge weight has lifted off my shoulder despite my initial feelings of disappointment and shame, and I think I am better off not fucking my health up anymore and finding different ways to get to where I want. When you are unsure about what you want in life or what job or do not know if you will be unhappy all your life, you have to keep trying different things and if you still feel unhappy you have to find out if it is a temporary life setback you can push through and eventually feel better about or if it is something that you need to stop and try something else entirely. The only way you will find out is to keep trying. And you have to work on the life skill of being able to know who you are as a person and have a healthier sense of identity to better grasp what those gut feelings are when you are trying things but unsure if you stay or move on. Some people it takes them decades to figure themselves out but remember this is your journey. There is not a right or wrong choice, there is just a choice you make hoping it will bring you the most happiness doing so or the least discontentment out of every other option. Also everytime I tell an adult or therapist my life situation and rough time changing career goals they say \"you are only 24? Man you are still really young and got a whole life ahead of you do not even worry about feeling like you wasted your 20s\" \ud83e\udd21"

Make sure your request includes the direct plea to help connect you with resources today. If they hand you a print out of phone numbers that is one thing and not really that helpful. What you need is somebody to walk you over the computers, show you how to log in, and show you how to make an appointment request with community health services. That kind of thing.

        "completion": "Lucas, I am really really sorry this is happening to you. I am going to be honest that I do not know what the best course of action is for you, I do not know what it is like to be in your shoes exactly though I have had some, similar experiences and issues. I get it is scary to talk to someone about it. And friends can be dumb at that age. You really need to talk to someone though bud, and I do not think looking for some strangers to talk to online is the healthiest course of action. Putting yourself out here like this, it leaves open the potential for creeps and weirdos to take advantage of you in your vulnerable state and try to groom you or manipulate you even further. I know it is hard, I know it is terrifying and seems like an impossible task, believe me I do, but I think you need to talk to your parents or school counselor. You do not have to tell your parents what happened, at least not at first. You could just say you are really struggling right now, that you cannot do it anymore and you need help, let them know how hard it was to ask for help. Make them take you to someone professional to get involved that can help you figure out how to navigate this and how to eventually tell your parents in a way that you feel safe maybe with a professional present if you are scared of their reaction. You really need to remember some key things here. First off, unless your parents are monsters, I am sure that they love you and want you to be safe and ok. I know it does not always feel that way and parents can be scary. I am 35 and still scared of mine, believe me. But I can pretty much guarantee they just want you safe and happy. As for school counselors, teachers, professional therapists, they are all in the job they are in because they care about people. Teachers and school counselors care about their students even if they also get annoyed by their students. They want you to be safe and happy. Lucas the most important thing of all to remember is that this is not your fault. Ok? Seriously, it is not. I know you are at that awkward stage where you feel like an adult already, and sure in a lot of ways you are grown, but you are still a kid. You are the vulnerable one, the impressionable one. I am not saying that to put you down it is just facts. This person took advantage of that. Maybe she has a fucked up childhood to and maybe you empathize with that and feel sorry for her. But my friend, she is a predator treating you like prey. You are not responsible for what happened to her as a kid. You are not responsible for fixing her and her taking advantage of you will not help either of you it will literally just ruin both of your lives. That woman is sick. She needs help. You are suffering and you also need help. But dude as someone over twice your age who went through a lot of similar shit, do not bottle this all up. Do not keep hurting yourself. Do not keep blaming yourself. You have to start forgiving yourself and looking out for yourself right now. Because if you do not this will all eat at you and it will only get worse as you get older. Then it will only be even more difficult to address. It is ok to ask for help Lucas. You are doing it here now and that is really brave of you, it is a good first step. But anonymous strangers like us cannot help you out of this one bud. Trust me it is how I tried to get out of my situation at your age and, I found a lot of both groomers and toxic doomers who only helped to make things worse for me. Please Lucas, be kind to yourself. Get yourself the help you need and deserve. You will feel so much more at ease with the weight of this secret off your shoulders and with the help of your loved ones and professionals. You matter. You really do. You matter and you are loved by your family and your friends, even if they do not always show it:"

        "completion": "Damn dude I do not have advice but that fucking sucks. The one thing that might help you to consider is that it sounds to me like she is bringing it up so much - especially the fact that she is unhealthy - because she wants you to care about it. I Do Not Know how this sounds, because going about it this way is not cool on her end (and this might not even be your concern) but if she does just want you to care, she clearly values the care you give her and sees you as someone who is attention she desires as she struggles. Like I know this might not change anything, but I do not think she is losing weight and feeling better than you or something. She clearly wants you to know she is unhealthy and to react by giving her attention. I do not mean that in an accusatory way, she probably needs it for real. But that does not mean it is easy or fair to feel like you have to respond with concern all the time for your partner to be ok. But ultimately I do not think she is necessarily trying to compete with you or make you feel shitty about yourself, so much as get your attention because she feels inferior in your presence. She is probably far more wrapped up in her own perspective, which sounds pretty insecure right now to be honest. Edit: I also want to be clear that I do not think it is insensitive of you in anyway to be triggered by your girlfriends behavior. If I were in your shoes I would also be super triggered and it is so kind of you to be asking how to support her. Remember it is ok to tell her what you need too. Her mental health is important but yours is too. I am just so sorry you are going through this and you cannot find support from your girlfriend directly right now.

It started as a way to get out of trouble, prolong any punishment my parents might dish out, stuff like that. It then turned it white lies and stupid things I would say in High School to make myself sound cooler. I Am 21 now, and I just ruined a relationship with a girl that I was building for a while because of my lying. She cared about me, and knew I needed help, and pushed me to get it. It turned into me telling her that I had actually gone to a doctor and gotten medication, when i had not. She found out in October, and has not spoken to me since. I do not want to be doing this, its hurting me. I Have lost jobs, ruined relationships, and I do not think I can succeed in life if I do not solve this. What do I do? My parents are willing to help me and ask what I want to do, but I genuinely do not know. They recommend inpatient therapy, and now we are researching it. Its not something that I want to do, but I think it might be good in the long run. I currently do not have a job and do not go to school, but I want to start a career as an electrician because trades are a great career. Should I do the inpatient therapy, then start that path, or can I do both at the same time. Thanks for all the help",
        "completion": "\"Compulsive\" lying is a maladaptive coping skill people learn, not a mental disorder. People lie like this when they are taught as kids that telling the truth is not safe and will not get them what they want, or will get them taken advantage of or hurt. Especially when there are narcissists around. And the second factor is when kids are \"seen and not heard\" and never taught to self-advocate or assert themselves. Instead of trying to \"fix the lying\" fix the reasons. Practice assertiveness, asking for what you want, maintaining boundaries, saying NO, and negotiating when faced with people asking you to do things you do not want to do or not giving you what you want. These are SKILLS that you can learn that are effective replacements for these kinds of lies. In my opinion; going to a psych prison where you are going to have NO control, do not get to say no to anything, and do not get to ask for what you want is only going to reinforce the negative beliefs that make you feel like you have to lie. There is likewise no benefit to medication for this problem. Both of these suggestions strike me as \"you are broken so go do the thing I saw on TV and get fixed for my comfort\" rather than \"research.\" One boundary I would start to set- stop letting your healthcare decisions be a \"we.\" You decide what treatment, therapy etc to pursue, and with who, and how, and when. When other people stick their nose across that line- Listen to what they have to say if you respect their opinion, and then tell them \"No.\" Even if you think they are doing it because they care, how it makes you feel shows through when you lie to evade it."

        "completion": "Sorry in advance, this is long There are a few things that come to mind, and please keep in mind that I am in no position to asses or diagnose anything. You should make an appointment with a mental health professional when you can, to discuss these things and look into further options. I know you said that is not an option right now, but it is worth noting there are some things that only they can help with (especially regarding medications and such). If you are not sure where to go, talk with your GP/PCP about wanting to get established with therapy or something along those lines. If you feel comfortable going into detail with that person though, some practitioners can prescribe medications for mental health as well With that in mind, there are a couple things that come to mind. First, regarding the subject of those actions, it might be worth looking into your current diet and making sure you are not deficient in any vitamins. Vitamin deficiencies can create unusual cravings and unexpected behavior changes. If so, diet is the best way to get those vitamins, but supplements can also be used (just do not take more than the recommended amount, because you can overdose on vitamins as well). You can also talk to your doctor in the future about blood testing (metabolic panel) to determine more definitively where you are at with those things as well The other things that come to mind are more mental health focused. But not in a \u201cit is all in your head\u201d way, rather, in a \u201cthese might be specific challenges you are facing\u201d way. Very broadly speaking, it sounds like you may be dealing with compulsions (\u201cdo this thing or something bad will happen\u201d), especially given that you find it near impossible to control them. I do not know about these, so I do not want to speak where I lack information, but it may be worth looking into more on your own, or with a professional The other thing that could be a factor (again, not a professional and I cannot say with certainty) is some level of dissociation. Dissociation is a disconnect between various aspects in experiences. This can include thoughts, emotions, memory, and even disconnecting from your own body or the world around you (depersonalization/derealization respectively). That \u201cwatching yourself do things from the back seat\u201d feeling is one I am very familiar with, having a dissociative disorder myself. Dissociation is not always disordered though, I should note. Everyone dissociates some in their lives. If you have ever read the same paragraph over a few times without understanding it, or forgotten the car ride home, those are examples of non-harmful dissociation Because what you are describing sound like it is distressing and impacting your life negatively, it is not my first thought that it is a normal level of dissociation. However, that does not mean it is disordered either. If you deal with a lot of stress or anxiety (which can also be tied to compulsions), that may be a factor, especially if you have been dealing with that more recently before these experiences. This is also true if you have a history of prolonged stress or trauma, or if emotions are difficult to handle. Dissociation is a common coping skill for those things All of this is to say that these can be normal experiences. Not necessarily average or common, but completely understandable and a normal human experience in the right circumstances. You are not alone. Even if there are different causes, you are not \u201ccrazy\u201d (few people who worry about being crazy actually are) If you look into these things on your own, you may come across things like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or Dissociative Identity Disorder. This does NOT mean you have these things, just that there is symptom overlap. But just as I would sooner assume a sneeze is a cold and not cancer (even if that is a distinct possibility), I would not jump the gun on all of the possibilities For now, the strongest recommendation I can give is to focus on managing stress (try looking up grounding techniques), see if your diet is lacking in anything, and keep a log/journal about these experiences, especially as they do (or do not) relate to changes stress or anxiety. This way, you have documentation for yourself, but also to show any professionals if you take the step of setting appointments. It can help to identify patterns or triggers, and how to more forward from there Best of luck, and my DMs are always open if you need to talk"

        "prompt": "A very close friend ghosted me due to their depression. - It is been 4 months and it is not just me, they cut everybody off. I was closer to them in particular. I was not an exception. To give some context, we had a friendship where we could talk about anything, anytime. We went through some of the toughest times together and went to the same university after highschool. They were the one who I went to when I had problems and I was the one they (who was a particularly closed-off individual) came to. They were the first friend who I would ever been vulnerable with. We have even been the subject of a few gay jokes. Our friendship had been going on strong for 4 years, but one day they dropped out, cut everybody off, and exited my life like they never even existed in the first place. I have tried contacting them 3-4 times over the past months but it is been radio silence. My friends tell me that their attempts at communication have been similarly unsuccessful. They were not particularly open about their mental health struggles but the signs seems to be pointing towards depression. While I do have my own problems, depression has never been one of mine so I am asking for advice. How can I help them, if I even can? Or how should I treat them? If anybody in this subreddit had previously ghosted people due to their depression, how did you want to be treated? Should they come back, should I rekindle this friendship? I want to understand them. Any advice would help.",
        "completion": "I self isolated in periods of deep depression. When someone is severely depressed, there is no energy to maintain relationships. Even basic hygiene drains all the energy from you. I was very greatful to the friends that kept texting me throughout my self isolation. One even sent me a card with a note reminding me that they would always be there for me, no matter what I was going through. I kept that card as a reminder of the best qualities of a true friend. Unfortunately, you cannot pull someone out of depression. There are many ways to successfully treat depression, which can include therapy and medication. But the depressed person must commit to getting better. You sound like a wonderful, caring friend. The best you can do is to continue to communicate with them. You want them to know that you care deeply about them, that you value the friendship, and that you would love to talk about what is happening in their life when they are ready. Fortunately, I was able to reconnect with people after depressive episodes ended, and the episodes became less frequent once that I got professional help. Your friend may reach out to you. If they open up about being depressed, or other mental health issues, you could encourage them to talk to their doctor or a mental health professional. Let them know that there is hope of overcoming depression, tens of thousands of people have done so. Try not to be offended. They likely still value you and the friendship. They are just lost right now, and they do not know how to find their way back to you. I pray that you are able to maintain the friendship through this difficult period, and that your friend finds a path back to you."

        "prompt": "Need words of encouragement - I am afraid; of emotional pain and suffering. I know I have to deal with this in order to heal myself but I am so scared. I do not want to go through it. Maybe that is why I have not really tried to heal my core wounds; because I am afraid of the pain that is guaranteed to surface. In the past, I have shoved the \u2019dust\u2019 (aka the pain) under the rug and just ignored it or told it to \u2018go away\u2019. Neither of those things really work; they may work temporarily but the pain always comes back unless the source (core wound) can be healed. But, in order to heal the source of my pain, I need to get through it. Imagine a rose bush full of thorns that is not thriving; in order to get the bush to thrive properly and get to the roots of the bush, you need to go through all those thorns. You may be scratched and bleeding at the end but those wounds will heal and the roses will be better for it. I do not know if I will ever be ready to deal with the pain that comes with healing, so I have consistently put off the journey. I know that I cannot anymore but I do not know how to handle it all. For context, I came up with that rose bush analogy on the fly.",

        "prompt": "Could this likely be possible DID? I just need opinions[LONG] - Tw: small talk of sh, dissociation (This is a second post about this. Original post was posted in r/dissociation. It did not get many responses so i am just looking for more honest opinions. Responses told me they might be a little biasd so i went here to a sub that is more general in mental illness i guess. I Am not looking for diagnosis. Just advice and opinions. That is all) Over quite a period of time, I have been experiencing a range of symptoms that I find to be concerning and very scary. It really stresses me out and I do not know what else may be explaining all of my experiences so I Do Not Know I guess I just need opinions on if I am being dramatic or sensitive or something about all of this. Or if it actually sounds serious to you. So I will just jump into everything that is happened and I will try to make this organized. This will be lenhy though. The blackouts: I have been having quite a few blackouts lately. They are all always unexpected and I never am aware of them until family members tell me and I will just be so confused out of my life. They would blame me for doing something that I do not remember doing AT ALL and it will always be something that I will never do too. Like just never because it is absolutely nothing like me. But they all apparently saw me doing it and there have been evidence of it. And it will just be so scary because it happens just randomly and I will not even notice it. I think so far I have had 4 blackouts, over a period of couple of months. Some of them happened really close to each other's times. One more recent. I could go into details about the blackouts but if I did then it will be WAY WAY TOO LONGG and this is already going to be long enough. I would say that I do suspect that I have missed a very important family event because of it. And someone had took over by maybe a couple of days because when I came back so much stuff was happening that I had no clue about and one of them even involved me which just confused me so much on what I have actually might have missed. The last thing I remember was just putting my stuff in my bag so I could leave and then just instant blackness. No idea what the Frick happened at all or what my sister was talking about or whatever. There was also another blackout where I went to our presumed \"inner world\" and I saw the voices faces and their houses and their powers. That I did not knew that they had. So if those things help then that is all I will say. One of them people there who was a witch told everyone there that I was not allowed back in there anymore so I stopped going to that place after that blackout. Weird identity changes: There have been some times where i would start to feel like an entirely different person. Or feel like I do not even know who I am and then I would just panic and deeply stress about it. I would do things that I would NEVER do like ever. And it will be unreasonable honestly why i would just suddenly feel like that or think like that. Some of the things I am just absolutely incapable of doing too like skill wise and knowledge wise. The most recent time this happened was with painting. Now I am a good artist, i very much recongize that. But my drawing has kind of gotten worse. I cannot draw realism all that well anymore and I have a very very hard time drawing heads. Nowadays I just paint acrylics and use whatever I have left of my drawing skill. There was this one time where I was painting and I was panicking over a mistake I did. I desperately tried to fix it so badly and I just did anything I could. When I started panicking though, I heard a voice in my head that just told me what to do to fix it. And then I even felt myself moving on its own, painting on its own. Painting completely differently than I do in terms of style and brush strokes. They were extremely precise and used brush techniques that I do not even know. What they did really actually improved my painting a lot and practically saved it. This voice had also forced me to just stop painting because they told me that I was painting in the same area for too long. Which I indeed was. I just needed someone to force me to just relax. This happened again like four days ago or so. Like i said, I cannot draw heads well and have a hard time sketching out the figures. But that time I just weirdly felt confident and I knew exactly what to do. I knew how to capture the figure and how to accurately draw each line. I felt just suddenly influenced with this knowledge. And when the feeling had gone away and I had tried again to sketch. It went absolutely terribly. I completely just gave up on it then. The voices: I have mentioned them in the last section but I am going to go into some more examples of what they say and did and generally how I know they are not just \"thoughts\". 1. One of them started speaking to me in Spanish, which I cannot speak at all. I do not know Spanish at all besides me knowing how to just say my name in Spanish. They were not telling me that though, it sounded like something much longer and complicated. I recognized only 3 words of what they were saying. 2. They have agruments with each other pretty often. They also would just come to me and tell about something another voice did to them in the \"inner world\". One time, it was so so overwhelmingly loud because these two were just screaming at each other over something so fucking stupid and small. It was so so so fucking annoying. 3. They vent to me sometimes about things that is really been bothering them. One voice in particular, I feel like we really bonded because of how much they shared with me. This is how I learned that a lot of them are carrying some serious tramua. 4. There was a one time where a voice caused a blackout. I just started feeling them there, like right next to me in my head. And then suddenly I am just overflooded with their laughter. My vision suddenly changed and everything appeared in a pink and blue color. Then things just went completely black. And I found myself in a different position on my bed. I do not remember them saying anything but I know they were there for sure. I even know their name. There is probably more but I do not remember them. I have had a lot of out of body experiences and dissociative epsiodes. Two where I saw someone doing and saying something differently to how I speak usually. One where I saw someone try to harm themselves. I did not really see it though I just heard someone saying that they were going to do that? I cannot exactly see during these out of body experiences. I know they were stopped though by another voice I have heard. This was also kind of of a blackout too cuz i do not remember anything that really actually happened. Previously though, a voice was telling me that they were going to come out and hurt themselves so I just assume that is what happened. I would say more about that but I feel like this is getting too long already and I think it might be enough? I could always answer more in the comments though to clarify anything if this post was all just too jumbled up. One more clarification I never took any drugs or alcohol I am not diagnosed with anything or on medication for anything. My last clinician did told me that I had depression though but I was never on any anti-depressants or anything. I Do Not Know if that was even a diagnosis I do not think clinicians can diagnose.",

Almost from day 1, the \u201droutine\u201d is what she describes as soul crushing and life sucking. This is to the point that she leaves the house on the verge of tears and will not even kiss me goodbye. She is so down that you would think she lost someone yesterday but has to go to work. I should note that jobs have been office, retail, farmhand (horses), set hours, shift, and medical related. All sorts except factory work. She is very much the guy from \"Office Space\" but with depression to boot. She does have PTSD. I have always told her that whatever she wants to do is fine with me so long as she is happy and paying her share of the bills but she only wants to work jobs that pay very little and wants to sell art. She is using medical cannabis grudgingly but refuses any other therapy or medication. (Xanax did help some, but she does not like how it makes her feel and her family has a history of addiction issues). She does have a graduate degree and had no problem attending school but does not work in her field. I have been as supportive as I can but I cannot continue. I need a partner, not a child. I am constantly stressed out and frustrated. I am cooking, cleaning, and working a full time job to give her decompression time to make it easier on her but nothing seems to make a difference. It is really dragging me down like an anchor. I cannot be happy myself anymore. I feel blah at best and perpetually anxious at worse. I do not know what to do to get her confidence up and get her into a job she likes enough to tolerate and feel fulfilled.",
        "completion": "I kind of had a similar experience in the workforce, I earned a graduate degree and failed to enter my field and bounced around about 4 or 5 jobs over the next 8 years. I currently have my own small business doing landscaping projects for people. I am very lucky that my wife has a pretty successful sales career, but my increased availability to support her, spend more quality time, and take care of our dogs and the house while still contributing a little cash has been more fulfilling than any previous.working role I have held. I hated traditional work environments and referred to them as soul crushing also, but my issues were probably not as severe as you describe with your wife. I would highly recommend therapy, either single sessions or couples counseling. Not sure what her reasons are for refusing it, but it can be very helpful and therapeutic to air your stress and trauma and formulate constructive steps and strategies you each can take so your wife can live her life with more conviction and less worry. And whatever changes or steps forward she can take always remind her that you are proud of her form making those steps. You sound very supportive of her by trying to take a lot of the burden off of her and I hope you guys can find some balance and she can hopefully feel less uncomfortable in the future. Hope any of that helps."

        "prompt": "Hello, Could we appreciate my will not to self harm? - Hey, so a lot of times recently I have been thinking about when I started to self harm. I remember having so strong compulsive thoughts that were so so hard to deal with when I was i do not know 11, 12. The thoughts were so strong that I wanted to do it but then told myself that I cannot and that it is crazy. So I used to hide the sharp objects, I did not want to even see anything, not to shave and so on because I was really scared that I would do it, deep inside I wanted to but also was scared and I knew that it is not right. And I think that I was quite succesful because I guess I did not do it which I find really strange right now so my mind keeps coming back to the past and replaying some memories because I cannot believe it. I just have some feeling that I had to do it when I had those awful thoughts. But I would probably remember it. Also I did not have any cuts on body in pics. I find myself blaming these days for not doing it because I feel like I deserved it. To do it when I wanted to. Then I realized that I need to learn that it was kind of brave of me to overcome the thoights without actually doing it (eventho I still find myself coming back and thinking that I should have done it when others did at such a young age) I remember doing something with a pin when I was 12 because I saw boys in class do it. Then I started cutting when I was 13/14, more likely 14. My mind says to me that 14 is too old and that I had to start younger. It is a horrible feeling. So I think that if I heard other people appreciating me for not doing it before, my thoughts of blaming me and feelings of deserving it would go aside. Stay safe",
        "completion": "Proud of you. Keep it up. Do not compare things like as if there is a younger age to do that or is right better age to do that. It is bad. Take care of yourself, love yourself. Stop self harm."
