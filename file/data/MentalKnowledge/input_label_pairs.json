        "label_text": "Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life.\nMental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital.\nIt is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biology.\nSimilarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful."

Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background.\nAlthough mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children.\nAdditionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition.\nParents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs)."

Here are key points to keep in mind as you determine which information is worth considering and which information doesn't pass the test. \n It's so easy to spread information online, and we can't assume that the source we're reading or watching is the original source. Before you can evaluate anything, you need to know where the claims come from and determine if it's a reliable source. \n Reliable sources on the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness include the World Health Organization (WHO), Government of Canada ministries and agencies like Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Government of BC ministries and agencies like the BC Ministry of Health, and the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC). Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health sciences professionals are also important sources of information. \n Headlines and titles need to be simple and short, so they can sometimes be misleading on their own. They may also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more. \n Websites that belong to governments, government-funded agencies, well-known health providers, universities, or groups of medical professionals are generally the most reliable. Be careful of sites that don't list the author or don't tell you much about themselves. Double-check the author and the credentials of any 'experts' quoted or cited to see if they are actually experts in the topic being discussed. \n Can you find other evidence from other sources to support the claims? Does the author list their sources? Are the sources legitimate, like research journals? \n Unhelpful sources want you to feel a certain way: scared, angry, distrustful, vulnerable. Phrases like \"Skyrocketing rates of infection\" are sensational and they're meant to make people feel afraid. On the other hand, factual statements like \"We have 50 new cases in BC\" give you important information without playing into your emotions. Helpful news or information sources want you feel informed and empowered. \n Who is paying for the site? What products or services are being advertised? What links or other sites do they promote? Are you learning something from a story or experience, or are you simply being directed to buy a product or service? \n Social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, especially as we practice physical distancing or self-isolation. Social media can also be an important way to learn from health experts and connect to support services and mutual aid groups in your community. \n Like any other source of information, it's important to use good critical thinking skills when you use social media. Studies find that searching for health information on social media generally has very mixed results. You'll see both very poor-quality sources next to good-quality sources, and it's up to you to decide which is which. In addition, social media posts tend to be short and rarely capture everything you need to consider. They are generally useful as a way to start learning or exploring different points of view rather than a place to gather all the information. \n Visit www.mediasmarts.ca to learn more about digital and media literacy \n Visit www.healthnewsreview.org to learn more about thinking critically around health claims (this resource is no longer updated daily, but all toolkits and lessons are still available) \n This page is adapted from the Evaluating Mental Health and Substance Use Information info sheet."

If you anticipate a need, you can find application instructions and gather any documents or other pieces of information ahead of time \n Figure out how you'll manage times when you feel overwhelmed or hopeless, like calming activities, the number for a local support or crisis line, a video chat with a loved one, or a way to connect with your mental health care provider \n Look for local support organizations, neighbourhood groups, or mutual aid groups if you need extra help or support or would like to help others in your community \n Some planning will be straightforward, but you may also encounter situations or times when it's harder to see a solution or good plan of action. This is a great time to practice problem-solving skills. Problem-solving is a method that helps you break down a complicated situation into manageable pieces, look for realistic and unbiased information, brainstorm possible solutions, and test the solutions that you think might work well. Problem-solving is a helpful skill no matter what else is going on in the world, and it's an empowering, methodical approach when you might otherwise feel overwhelmed or lost. \n Check out the following resources for more information about problem-solving: \n Wellness Module 4: Problem-Solving: www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-4-problem-solving \n Problem-solving worksheet from Anxiety Canada: www.anxietycanada.com/sites/default/files/ProblemSolving.pdf \n Effective Problem-Solving in The Antidepressant Skills Workbook: psychhealthandsafety.org/asw"

        "label_text": "A lot of people are alone right now, but we don't have to be lonely. We're all in this together. \n While you may be physically separated from friends, family members, and other loved ones, it has never been more important to maintain those social connections. Social connections are an opportunity to seek and share support, talk through difficult feelings, share a laugh, keep up-to-date with loved ones, and help each other cope. This pandemic is a lot for one person to deal with on their own. While measures like physical distancing and self-isolation are necessary to slow the spread of the virus, the physical separation can amplify a lot of challenging emotions like loneliness and fear. \n Think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you. For example, you might prefer a video chat over a phone call, or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. \n Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. \n The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. \n Everyone feels lonely at times\u2014maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. \n Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. \n Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. \n Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone. To find community services in BC, call or text 211 or visit www.bc211.ca. \n If you need extra support, you can talk with a psychologist or counsellor for free: \n You can access a free phone call with a Registered Psychologist though the Covid-19 Psychological Support Service from the BC Psychological Association.

        "label_text": "Taking care of your physical health is also good for your mental health. It's more important than ever to keep yourself healthy. \n Try to eat as well as you can. It may be easier to reach for unhealthier comfort foods and snacks while you spend more time at home, but try to keep a balanced approach. When you stock up on groceries, don\u2019t ignore fresh fruit and vegetables\u2014we still have everything we need to prepare food. Now that we're advised to limit the amount of time we spend in public spaces like grocery stores, this is a great time to try out new fruits and vegetables that keep at home for longer periods of time. \n If it's safer for you to stay home or you are in self-isolation, reach out for help. Many grocery stores and meal prep services offer safe, no-contact delivery. You can also ask family or friends to bring you groceries, or look for local COVID-19 support groups on social media. It's safest if others leave food and other supplies outside of your door to avoid spreading the virus. \n Exercise is an important part of mental health and well-being, stress management, and health sleep. However, it's something that many people give up when they start to feel stressed or overwhelmed. \n If it's safe for you to do so, spend time outside. You should still avoid busy areas or groups and stay at least two metres away from others, but there is no reason to avoid walks, runs, or other safe outdoor activities. (Note that some municipalities, BC Parks, and Parks Canada have restricted some outdoor spaces to reduce crowds, so check the status of your local parks or trails and respect closures\u2014they're just keeping everyone safe.) \n If you prefer to exercise indoors, you can also find many different exercises classes online. You can try yoga, follow a barre class, work on your cardio, pick up a new dumbbell routine, and keep up with Crossfit WODs from the comfort of your living room. Look for no-equipment exercise routines or classes if you don't already have equipment. \n Poor sleep can make even simple problems feel a lot worse than they really are. Poor sleep can affect your mood, your outlook, and your patience. Unfortunately, stress and anxiety can really take a toll on your sleep. If you're having a hard time sleeping, be proactive and practice healthy sleep habits. For more, check out Wellness Module 6: Getting a Good Night's Sleep at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-6-getting-a-good-nights-sleep. \n If you have other health problems like a chronic illness, check in with your doctor or health care team to see if you need to take any additional measures or precautions. Remember to plan ahead and do what you can to keep prescription or over-the-counter medications, medical supplies, supplements, or other health needs on hand."

        "label_text": "Distraction is a very valid tool to help you cope when everything feels overwhelming or when you feel lonely or isolated. \n If you don't have a lot of energy or focus right now, try low-effort distractions like watching TV, browsing Youtube, listening to a podcast or audiobook, playing a game on your phone, reading an easy book or magazine, or working on a simple art project. \n If you have more energy and focus, give yourself a to-do list every day: you can clean and take care of projects around your home, work on hobbies, connect with family or friends, read a new book and catch up on your favourite TV shows. You can find interesting opportunities to take online courses from universities all over the world through MOOCs and other online learning platforms, you can learn a new language online or through apps, and you can learn new hobbies and activities. As more people have to practice social distancing or self-isolation, people are finding creative ways to bring the world into their homes: you can tour museums and art galleries, Skype with a scientist, watch animals at zoos and nature preserves, and more. \n When normal schedules are disrupted, it's easy to fall into unhelpful habits. Look for ways to keep yourself on track with healthier habits. You could set yourself goals every day or turn activities into a fun competition with friends or family\u2014whoever takes the most language classes wins! \n Many communities are using social media platforms like Facebook to organize support and help for neighbours. If you are healthy and it's safe to do so, you can sign up to walk dogs, pick up groceries and household supplies, and help others who can't go out at the moment. This can be a great way to make new connections in your area, and helping others is good for your own mental health. Just be sure to follow good hygiene practices and physical distancing\u2014your own health is important."

        "label_text": "How you think about something impacts your feelings and your behaviours. \n When we feel stressed out, angry, or fearful, it's hard to look at the situation realistically and see all of the options we have. (Remember: we all control our own actions and reactions, no matter what's going on in the world. We can call do something about this pandemic.) \n People often overestimate the negative parts\u2014their own feelings, their own abilities to manage a difficult situation, or the situation itself\u2014and underestimate positive parts\u2014their own abilities to care for themselves and loved ones, their support networks, and opportunities. \n How does the thought \"We're never going to make it through this!\" make you feel? It likely doesn't feel good\u2014and it isn't even true. \n Challenging negative, unhelpful thoughts can improve your mood, validate your ability to get through this, and help you see new options or opportunities to stay well. \n Stop and notice thoughts that come up. How do they make you feel? Do your thoughts seem realistic if you look at the situation more objectively? How can you reframe the thought to make it more productive or hopeful? Can you find any positive aspects or think of new ways to approach the situation? \n Here are a few example: \n \"I'm so mad that my event was cancelled! This sucks!\" \n \"I know this is the safer option for everyone. When it's rescheduled, I'll enjoy it more because I won't have to worry about getting sick or spreading the illness.\" \n \"I hate spending so much time at home. This is so boring.\" \n \"I'm doing my part to keep my neighbours safe. It's worth it because it keeps people healthy.\" \n \"I'm having a hard time getting used to my new schedule. This is so frustrating.\" \n \"I'll get used to this soon, just like I adapted the last time I had to change my schedule. Now that I'm home more, I'll have more time to finish the projects I haven't touched in months and I'm excited to see the end results. \n \"I'm really scared and I don't know what to do. I feel so overwhelmed right now.\" \n \"It makes sense that I feel scared\u2014people are getting sick and we don't know when things will go back to normal. But there are a lot of things I can do to keep healthy, and I'm going to do some research so I can do my best. When I focus on the things I can do, everything feels more manageable.\" \n \"We're going to be stuck inside forever. I'm already sick of this.\" \n \"I understand that it will take some time to manage COVID-19, and I trust that health care professionals and scientists are working as fast as they can. I know this will end eventually and life will go back to normal.\" \n The goal is not to ignore the bad or uncomfortable parts of the situation or deny that there's a problem. Instead, this exercise can help you understand the situation more realistically and see the parts that you can control right now."

        "label_text": "What you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do. Sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects\u2014this is normal and expected. However, when you interpret situations too negatively, you might feel worse. You're also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term. \n These automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps. Everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. You're most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad, angry, anxious, depressed or stressed. You're also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you're not taking good care of yourself, like when you're not eating or sleeping well. \n Here are some common thinking traps: \n Thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen. People who overgeneralize often use words like \"always\" or \"never.\" \n I was really looking forward to that concert, and now it\u2019s cancelled. This always happens to me! I never get to do fun things! \n Seeing things as only right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or terrible. People who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure. \n I wanted to eat healthier, but I ate too many snacks today. This plan is a total failure! \n Saying only negative things about yourself or other people. \n I made a mistake. I'm stupid! My boss told me that I made a mistake. My boss is a total jerk! \n Predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence. \n I've been doing what I can to stay home and reduce the risks, but I just know that I'm going to get sick. \n Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive. \n I know there's a lot I can do at home, but I'm just so sick of this. Everything is terrible. \n Believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation. \n I feel scared and overwhelmed right now, so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better. \n Telling yourself how you \"should\" or \"must\" act. \n I should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying! \n Here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. Many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills. You can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca. \n Don't try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way. \n This doesn't let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. When you try and push upsetting thoughts away, they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind. \n Ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens: \n What is the situation? What actually happened? Only include facts that everyone would agree on. \n What are your thoughts? What are you telling yourself? \n What are your emotions? How do you feel? \n What are your behaviours? How are you reacting? What are you doing to cope? \n Take a look at the thoughts you've listed. Are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns? It's common to fall into more than one thinking trap. Go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation. \n The best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts. Use the evidence you've collected to challenge your thinking traps. Here are some ways to do that: \n Try to find evidence against the thought. If you make a mistake at work, you might automatically think, \"I can't do anything right! I must be a terrible employee!\" When this thought comes up, you might challenge it by asking, \"Is there any evidence to support this thought? Is there any evidence to disprove this thought?\" You might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently, which doesn't support the idea that you're a bad employee. \n Ask yourself, \"Would I judge other people if they did the same thing? Am I being harder on myself than I am on other people?\" This is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self-criticism. \n Find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. For example, you might have trouble with one of your kids and think, \"Good parents wouldn't have this kind of problem.\" To challenge this thought, you can ask other parents if they've ever had any problems with their kids. \n Test your beliefs in person. For example, if you think that your friends don't care about you, call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call. If you assumed that they will all say no, you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you. \n Once you have worked through some challenges, try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps. Let's use the following example: \n I feel sad and overwhelmed. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do. \n I'm the worst! I should be able to handle this! \n Labeling \n 'Should' statements \n Examine the evidence: I have a lot of challenges right now. I'm worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. I've successfully handled complicated situations in the past, so I know I can do this. \n It's okay to feel upset right now\u2014there's a lot going on. I'm going to think about how I got through past situations and see what worked for me. I'm trying to do a lot on my own, so I'm going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together. \n Try the Healthy Thinking Worksheet at www.heretohelp.bc.ca \n Check out Anxiety Canada's articles Helpful Thinking and Thinking Traps \n This page is adapted from Wellness Module 8: Healthy Thinking at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-8-healthy-thinking."

This includes: \n Losing security, like losing your job or wondering how long you'll be able to pay rent \n Losing stability or routine, like finding yourself working from home or navigating childcare closures \n Losing your sense of safety, like fearing you or someone you love might end up with COVID-19 \n Losing your social relationships, like missing time with family and friends now that everyone must practice physical distancing or self-isolation \n Losing hope for the future, like feeling that life will never go back to normal \n Losing important goals, like finding your classes, sports competitions, or performances are cancelled for the foreseeable future \n Losing important milestone celebrations like graduation ceremonies and weddings \n Grief bring up complicated feelings. You might feel sad, angry, frustrated, fearful, or hopeless. You may have a hard time eating or sleeping, or feel very tense. You may feel overwhelmed and tired. You may wonder if life will ever feel normal again. \n Everyone grieves in their own way and their own time. Here are some strategies to try as you navigate your own journey. \n Acknowledge and express your feelings in a healthy way. Give your feelings a name and find healthy ways to express them, such as by talking with a friend, writing in a journal, or making art. \n Give yourself as much time as you need. Grief follows its own schedule. Give yourself permission to use this time to take care of your well-being. Let go of expectations, tasks, or other obligations that can wait. \n Seek support. Grief can feel very isolating, even though a lot of people are experiencing some sort of loss right now. Reach out to friends or family and share your feelings. Look for ways to help and support each other. \n Take care of yourself. Ignoring health and well-being can make difficult experiences feel worse. Eat as well as you can, try to get enough sleep, spend time outside if it's safe for you to do so, and exercise regularly. Think about self-care activities or strategies that have helped you cope with challenging situations in the past and make time for those activities. \n Know that feelings of grief will pass. Grief may feel intense at times, but those feelings will become more manageable over time and will eventually pass. \n Connect with a mental health professional if you're having a hard time. If you're having a hard time getting through the day, coping in unhealthy ways, or having a hard time managing difficult thoughts or feelings, it's a good idea to seek help from a professional like a psychologist or counsellor\u2014many now offer online or phone appointments.

Here are some general resources to help you find a mental health or substance use related support group in BC: \n Talk to your mental health care provider.

This can be particularly useful if you don\u2019t have a group in your community or have trouble getting to an in-person group. \n In order to benefit the most from a support group, you need to feel safe enough to share your experiences and thoughts, and you need to feel comfortable supporting others. It can be helpful to contact the group facilitator or organizer ahead of time to see if a particular group might be a good fit for you. We have a checklist to help you evaluate support groups\u2014including when it might be time to leave one. \n Sometimes a group just doesn\u2019t work for you, and that\u2019s okay.

Some use psychotherapy (\u2018talk therapies\u2019) approaches like cognitive-behavioural therapy to treat mental health problems. Many psychiatrists work at hospitals, clinics, or health centres, and some have a private office. As they are specialist doctors, you will almost always need another doctor\u2019s referral to see a psychiatrist, and fees are covered by MSP. If you have a valid BC Services or CareCard, you do not need to pay to see a psychiatrist. \n A registered psychologist focuses on different talk therapy or counselling approaches to treatments, but they don\u2019t prescribe medication. They have graduate degrees in psychology. There are two different ways to access registered psychologists: the public system and the private system. Registered psychologists in the public system work in some hospitals or schools. You may need a doctor\u2019s referral to access the program, and costs are usually covered by MSP. However, most people need to access registered psychologists through the private system. To do this, you can contact the psychologist yourself\u2014you do not need a referral. Costs are not covered by MSP, but they may be covered by employee health plans. A registered psychologist\u2019s fees charged by hour vary, and some offer lower fees to people with lower incomes. \n You\u2019ve probably noticed that a lot of the differences come down to how you pay for different services and how these professionals are educated. The practical differences in how they work are not always so clear. When it comes to your treatment and care, the most important part is finding a professional who supports your own goals. Are you really focused on fine-tuning medications? Are you looking for a particular therapy approach? Does the professional\u2019s philosophy of care make sense to you? Do you like the professional you\u2019re talking to and do you feel safe sharing your experiences? Ultimately, your relationship with the professional is what matters. Instead of focusing on designation, look for a professional who meets your needs and your expectations. \n Talk to your family doctor and ask for their recommendations \n Ask local mental health organizations for help.

Both are used to describe professionals who use talk-based approaches to help someone recover from a mental illness or mental health problem. Many different professionals may provide counselling or psychotherapy, including registered psychologists, registered clinical counsellors, psychiatrists, other therapists and counsellors, family doctors, psychiatric nurses, and faith leaders. \n It\u2019s useful to talk to someone about any problem\u2014a lot of people find that simply talking with friends or family can help them feel better. A professional therapist or counsellor can offer more: they have training, experience, and emotional distance (since they don\u2019t know you). They use different theories to listen to you, support you, and approach different problems or patterns. For example, a psychotherapy called cognitive-behavioural therapy is based on the theory that learning skills to change your thinking and actions can positively impact your emotions, well-being, and future thoughts and behaviours. A therapist could help you learn and practice these skills. \n There are many psychotherapies with good evidence of being effective for different problems or illnesses. A few examples include cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, solutions-focused brief psychotherapy, narrative therapy, and emotion-focused therapy. \n In general, some aspects of therapy and counselling are the same, no matter which approach you choose: the expectations you bring to your counselling sessions, the match between your understanding of the problems and your therapist\u2019s understanding of the problem, and the trust and rapport that you have with your therapist. In fact, one research review found that 50% of the improvement seen in clients who just received active listening and support from a counsellor (called non-directive supportive therapy) was due simply to the relationship between client and therapist.1 Psychotherapy can and does work, but the professional you choose, and their match with your values, is also very important. \n When you\u2019re looking for a professional, it\u2019s always a good idea to ask if they are a member of a professional organization (like those listed in the next section)."

For example, if you believe that people don\u2019t like you (thought), you might avoid social situations (behaviour) and feel lonely (feeling). However, CBT teaches you how to use these relationships to your advantage: a positive change in one factor (changing a thought or behaviour) can lead to positive changes in all factors. CBT is an approach that has been proven by research to work for many different mental health problems, including depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and substance use problems. \n CBT is structured, short-term, goal-oriented and focused on the present. It starts with education around the particular mental illness or challenge and how the illness or challenge affects you. Next, you\u2019ll learn and practice skills and strategies like problem-solving or realistic thinking to help you make changes in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. You\u2019ll learn how you can use your new skills to deal with problems in the future. \n Dialectical behaviour therapy or DBT is based on CBT, with greater focus on emotional and social aspects. DBT was developed to help people cope with extreme or unstable emotions and harmful behaviours. DBT is an evidence-based approach to help people regulate emotions. It started as a treatment for borderline personality disorder, and current research shows it may help with many different mental illnesses or concerns, particularly self-harm. \n Key differences between CBT and DBT are validation and relationships. DBT teaches you that your experiences are real, and it teaches you how to accept who you are, regardless of challenges or difficult experiences. Relationships are also very important in DBT\u2014including the relationships between you and your DBT practitioner. You may have frequent check-ins to talk about any successes or problems. Treatment may include a mix of one-on-one sessions and group sessions. In addition to CBT skills, you\u2019ll learn skills around managing your emotions, building relationships with others, coping well with problems or distress, acceptance, and mindfulness. \n As with many talk therapies, it takes time and effort to enjoy the benefits of CBT and DBT skills. But once people master skills with support from your CBT or DBT therapist, they often find that their new skills and strategies become second nature\u2014they are tools that last a lifetime."

The first name is the generic name and name in brackets is the brand name. \n SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Cipralex), and sertraline (Zoloft) \n SNRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors: venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) \n NDRIs or norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors: bupropion (Wellbutrin and Zyban) \n NaSSAs or noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants: mirtazapine (Remeron), which can also be classed as a TeCa or tetracyclic antidepressant \n SARIs or serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors: trazodone (Desyrel) \n There are other classes of antidepressants (such as MAOIs or triclycics) that are much older and have more side effects or restrictions. They are usually prescribed when newer antidepressants don\u2019t work. Other medications such as lithium, thyroid medication, or antipsychotics may also be prescribed, often in combination with an antidepressant to boost its effect. Antidepressants are not only used to treat depression\u2014they may be prescribed to treat other illnesses like anxiety disorders. \n Only medical doctors like family doctors or psychiatrists can prescribe antidepressants. If your doctor recommends that you consider antidepressants, keep in mind that most people have to try a few different options before they find the right medication. It can be a frustrating process, especially when you feel unwell, but it\u2019s important to find something that works for you! Side effects and benefits can vary significantly between different people, and it\u2019s difficult to predict how a medication might work without trying it out first. Everyone responds to them differently. It\u2019s very important to have ongoing discussions with your health care team regarding your medication so you can bring up any problems or concerns\u2014or even ask more about how your particular antidepressant works."

That way, the professional can answer your questions and you can better understand their decision. \n If that doesn\u2019t resolve the situation or a follow-up appointment isn\u2019t possible, you can ask for a second opinion. A second opinion is an assessment from a different professional. This can give you better understanding of what\u2019s going on and what to do about it. Second opinions are common when it comes to major health decisions\u2014you won\u2019t hurt anyone\u2019s feelings and your doctor will try to accommodate reasonable requests for a second opinion.

        "label_text": "If you\u2019re concerned about your medications, it\u2019s important to talk with the doctor or psychiatrist who prescribed your medications. While it can take a few weeks to really see improvements with many antidepressants, it\u2019s still a good idea to talk to your doctor about what to expect. \n Talk to the doctor that prescribed your medication if you experience symptoms or side effects that are distressing you. If you want to talk to a trusted professional about the most common side effects, call your pharmacist. You can reach a pharmacist by phone after-hours by calling 811. \n It\u2019s also best not to stop taking the medication or changing the dose on your own without first talking to a health care provider. While it might be tempting to stop taking your medication when you start feel better, it\u2019s important to follow your doctor\u2019s instructions. \n In some cases, people can have an allergic reaction to a medication. Some reactions are not serious, like a rash. In these cases, you can call the pharmacist or call 811 to reach help after-hours. If you have a serious reaction like difficult breathing, dizziness, or confusion, call 911 right away. \n When you start a new medication, your pharmacist will give you a printout with information like side effects, signs of an allergic reaction, how long it might take to work, and other information. It\u2019s good information to keep on hand, but it isn\u2019t always easy to read. When you pick up your medication, you can ask the pharmacist to go over the information with you so you understand what you should look for. \n If a particular antidepressant or psychiatric medication just isn\u2019t working for you, there are many different options! Unfortunately, finding the right medication can take some trial and error. Different people can have very different experiences with the same medication, and often you need to try something to see if it works (or doesn\u2019t work) for you. This can be a frustrating process, especially when you want to start feeling better, but it\u2019s important to keep trying and work with your doctor so you understand your options. Many people feel intimidated talking to health professionals, but it\u2019s important to share information so you both understand what\u2019s going on and can make good, informed decisions about your health care. Some people also feel embarrassed talking about symptoms or side effects like changes in sex drive or digestion, but its important information for your doctor (and they know that changes in sex drive or digestion are common concerns). You can find strategies, including a mood journal, to help you work with doctors and other health care providers in our Working With Your Doctor toolkit."

        "label_text": "It\u2019s difficult when an adult child, sibling, parent, friend, co-worker, or other important person is struggling or behaving in ways that are causing harm. This can be a tricky situation\u2014you want to help, but most adults are responsible for their own care. \n There are two important points to think about. First, diagnosing a health condition, especially when symptom-checking is so easy online, can be dangerous. Diagnosis is still always best left to professionals who can look at the whole picture. Remember, too, that the person you care about may have a very different idea of what\u2019s causing their difficulties and what the negative impacts are on their life. Second, except in rare cases, the person being treated needs to be an active player in their own recovery to continue with their treatment, just as they would for any other health problem. If the vast majority of cases, you cannot do this work entirely for them\u2014and trying to do so may damage your relationship. \n Be honest about your concerns, the impacts you are seeing that worry you, listen to their point of view and work together to find a solution that works for everyone, even if it means a compromise. You may want to offer to go with them to an appointment, encourage them to do an online screening self-test, or involve someone else close to them who may be similarly concerned and may have more influence in encouraging them to notice changes and seek help. Because you may be feeling frustrated and helpless, it\u2019s important to get care and support for yourself during this time, especially if you\u2019re very close to the person you\u2019re worried about. \n In serious situations, the BC Mental Health Act allows someone to be held for a period of time for psychiatric assessment without their consent if they are at risk of harming themselves or others. While it\u2019s necessary in some situations to get someone the care they need, it can be traumatic for everyone involved.

        "label_text": "We naturally want to help a loved one who isn\u2019t feeling well. How we can or should help may seem fairly obvious when a loved one experiences a physical health problem, but many people say they\u2019re not sure how to best help when a loved one experiences a mental illness like depression. Here are some tips: \n You don\u2019t have to understand exactly what someone else is experiencing, you just need to recognize that it\u2019s a difficult experience. You can try something like, \u201cI can see that this experience or these symptoms are really painful for you,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling unwell.\u201d If you have experienced depression yourself, you might say, \u201cI know how you feel.\u201d Just remember that everyone experiences illnesses like depression differently, and empathy is about recognizing the impact of the illness, not comparing symptoms. \n You don\u2019t have to be an expert, but learning more about depression can help you understand what\u2019s going on (and maybe dispel some of the unhelpful myths around depression). Our Depression info sheet is a great place to start, and we have a list of resources at Q&A: Where can I learn more about depression? \n Sometimes talking about problems or concerns can really help\u2014in fact, many people who experience a mood disorder say that they just want to be heard. It\u2019s important to understand that talking about something difficult like experiences of depression can be very hard for your loved one. You cannot force them to talk about it, but you can invite them to, and create safe and quiet spaces to talk. If a loved one opens up to you, listen actively\u2014that is, without distractions like your phone or the TV. Really pay attention to what they have to say. Listen with empathy and without judgement. Even if you don\u2019t understand the problem or see the problem in a different way, your main concern is the distress or difficult feelings your loved one is experiencing. You can find in-depth tips on listening and communicating well in Module Three of the Family Toolkit. Some people are not ready to talk about everything at once, or at all. That\u2019s okay! Respect your loved one\u2019s boundaries and let them tell you what they\u2019re ready to talk about. \n Even when you have the best intentions, unsolicited advice can be unhelpful. You likely can\u2019t fix the problem, and you may not know the whole story. If you\u2019d like to share what worked for you in a similar situation, you can ask if the other person would like to talk about strategies that worked for you. \n Different people need different things\u2014don\u2019t assume you know what\u2019s best! Some people need emotional help, like someone they can talk with. Other people may have a good relationship with a counsellor or other professional, but they might need practical help, like help around the house or help sticking to their treatment plan. And others may simply want to be included in some social events. By asking what a person needs, you may also be less tempted to give advice. \n When people experience an episode of depression, they can have a lot of very negative thoughts and feelings. This can take a real toll on others. It\u2019s a good idea to seek support for yourself\u2014there are support groups just for family members and friends. The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of family support groups around BC for any mental illness. \n If your loved one isn\u2019t happy with their treatment or would like to try a different option, you can also help them seek different resources or services. You can find general advice in the Ask Us section of HeretoHelp. To find local services, call the BC Mental Health Support Line at 310-6789 (no area code) or email us. \n This is very important! You are not responsible for your loved one\u2019s treatment (unless your loved one is your child under 19)\u2014but you can support them as they work towards recovery. In most cases, your loved one\u2019s treatment and recovery plans are their choice\u2014you are there to offer support and encouragement. \n In order for any treatment to work, your loved one needs to be actively involved. Forcing or threatening treatment generally doesn\u2019t work and will only hurt everyone involved. In most cases, anyone 19 years of age and older is free to make their own choices. And their choices may include refusing treatment or choosing a treatment you disagree with. It\u2019s important to be respectful and keep honest communication open between you. You can learn more about dealing with this situation in Ask Us: An adult in my life seems ill and won\u2019t find help. What can I do? \n If your loved one says that they have thoughts of ending their life, it\u2019s important to take action. Call 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433) at any time or message online at www.crisiscentrechat.ca between noon and 1am.

How we can or should help may seem fairly obvious when a loved one experiences a physical health problem, but many people say they\u2019re not sure how to best help when a loved one experiences a mental illness like schizophrenia. Here are some tips: \n You don\u2019t have to be an expert in schizophrenia, but learning more can help you understand what\u2019s going on. There are a lot of myths about schizophrenia, so it\u2019s a good idea to find some trustworthy resources. Our Schizophrenia info sheet is a great place to start. You can also find a lot of information from the BC Schizophrenia Society. \n Sometimes talking about problems or concerns can really help. It\u2019s important to understand that talking about something difficult like experiences of schizophrenia can be very hard for your loved one\u2014and the symptoms of schizophrenia can also make conversations difficult. If a loved one opens up to you, listen actively\u2014that is, without distractions like your phone or the TV. Really pay attention to what they have to say.

Even if you don\u2019t understand the problem or you see the problem in a different way, your main concern is the distress or difficult feelings your loved one is experiencing. You can find in-depth tips on listening and communicating well in Module Three of the Family Toolkit. Some people are not ready to talk about everything at once, or at all. That\u2019s okay! Respect your loved one\u2019s boundaries and let them tell you when they\u2019re ready to talk. \n Symptoms of schizophrenia like hallucinations (sensations that aren\u2019t real, like hearing voices) or delusions (beliefs that can\u2019t be true, like believing that you are being followed by a spy) can take some time to stop even when people are receiving treatment and following their treatment plan. As a group, these very distressing symptoms are called psychosis. Many people have a hard time responding to a loved one\u2019s hallucinations or delusions. It\u2019s best to avoid arguing about these experiences. Remember that delusion are symptoms of schizophrenia\u2014they are not thoughts that you can talk someone out of. Telling someone that their experiences aren\u2019t real or aren\u2019t true doesn\u2019t help when the experiences feel very real to that person! A better approach is to empathize with the feelings that hallucinations or delusions bring up\u2014without confirming or denying the hallucination or delusion. For example, if a loved one is frustrated or upset when they hear voices, it isn\u2019t helpful to say something like, \u201cYou\u2019re okay! It isn\u2019t real. I don\u2019t hear anything.\u201d Instead, you might say, \u201cI can only image how upsetting that voice must be. I can see the voice makes you feel scared.\u201d Know that with good treatment and support, symptoms like hallucinations and delusions become much easier for people to manage and lose importance. \n Ask how you can help. When people experience a serious mental illness like schizophrenia, they may want to plan how they can take action if they start to feel unwell again, especially if they have dependent children. These plans, such as advanced directives or Ulysses Agreements, are made when a person feels well and are meant to communicate their wishes to loved ones and their care team. Ask your loved one if they have a plan in place so you know what they need if they need help. If you\u2019d like to learn more about planning for care, see the BC Schizophrenia Society. \n If a loved one is experiencing an episode of psychosis or is recovering for an episode of psychosis, they might need extra help. For example, people who are actively experiencing hallucinations or delusions might need a lot of personal space and feel uncomfortable being around a lot of people or even making eye contact. When people are recovering from an episode of psychosis, they may need a quiet space and a lot of rest. Sometimes people can get back into their usual routines fairly quickly, while other times it may take a lot of time (and effort) to get back into routines. Keep in mind that too much help can be a bit counterproductive. It may well be faster and easier for you to take care of your loved one\u2019s tasks or chores yourself, but rebuilding activity and confidence are a big part of recovery. Encourage and support your loved one as they take on daily responsibilities, and let them tell you when they need extra help. \n Schizophrenia can be a difficult illness\u2014for everyone. During episodes of psychosis, your loved one may experience frightening sensations that you can\u2019t understand. They may act in ways that you don\u2019t understand. Other symptoms of schizophrenia can make it hard for people to express emotions or feelings, communicate clearly, or seem interested in others. It\u2019s important to know that these are symptoms of an illness. They are no one\u2019s fault, but they can still be hard to cope with. Consider reaching out to a family and friends support group for your own support. The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of groups around BC at www.bcss.org/monthly-meetings-calendar/. \n As a family member, it\u2019s important to take care of yourself. Try to maintain your regular schedule and activities, such as your exercise routine and hobbies. Ask another family member or good friend to provide help with caregiving, especially in the early days of your loved one's illness. If you need help balancing time for self-care with caregiving duties, check out the BC Schizophrenia Society\u2019s Family Respite Program. \n Try to maintain your friendships or the network of people that you have in your life. These will later become important supports as your loved one recovers. Educate them and update them on your loved one's recovery. People are sometimes afraid to ask questions about schizophrenia and this will put them at ease. \n This is very important! You are not responsible for your loved one\u2019s treatment (unless your loved one is your child under 19), but you can support them. Schizophrenia can make it difficult for people to make and go to appointments and follow their treatment plan. With your loved one\u2019s permission, you may choose to help by reminding them of appointments, taking them to appointments, or whatever helps in your situation. If your loved one isn\u2019t happy with their treatment or would like to try a new approach, you can encourage them to talk with their care team, like their doctor or mental health team\u2014it can be dangerous to stop or change a treatment without a doctor\u2019s support. \n Treatment can be a difficult area for loved ones. It\u2019s hard to see someone you love in pain. You might be scared of the things your loved one is experiencing. You want to help. But in order for any treatment to work, your loved one needs to be active in their care. Forcing or threatening treatment generally doesn\u2019t work (or if it does, in the case of an emergency, only for a short time) and can often hurt everyone involved. In most cases, anyone 19 years of age and older and not at risk of harm is free to make their own choices. And their choices may include refusing treatment or choosing a treatment that you disagree with. It helps everyone if you can be respectful and keep honest communication open between you. You can learn more about dealing with this situation in Q&A: An adult in my life seems ill and won\u2019t find help. What can I do?. \n If you think your loved one is at risk of harming themselves or others and they refuse help, it is possible to have them evaluated by a psychiatrist under the Mental Health Act. This process may involve police and other first responders, and it can be a difficult and stressful process for everyone. But it can also be a necessary step if someone is in danger. You can learn more about the Mental Health Act in the info sheet Families Coping with a Crisis and you can find the Guide to the Mental Health Act at www.health.gov.bc.ca/library/publications/year/2005/MentalHealthGuide.pdf.

        "label_text": "Using cannabis has the potential for benefits and harms. Young people use cannabis, like other psychoactive drugs, to feel good, to feel better, to do better or to explore. Trying cannabis out of curiosity, as an experiment, or while socializing with friends, is related to moderate use and lower potential for harm. Using cannabis to cope with daily life, deal with unpleasant feelings, or fit in with a social group has higher potential for harm. This is because dealing with these kinds of issues is associated with frequent and heavier use, less thought about potential harms and little consideration of alternatives for coping such as talking with a parent or trusted adult or physical activity with friends. \n Evidence suggests that the younger a person is when they start using cannabis and the more often they use, the greater the potential for harms. The legal age to use cannabis in BC is 19. However, our brains do not finish developing until about age 25. Delaying cannabis use until early adulthood may reduce potential harmful effects on the brain. \n Some young people, especially those with many factors predisposing them to serious and persistent mental health issues, should probably not use cannabis. Cannabis has been associated with an increased risk for psychosis and schizophrenia in this small group of people. Some people with serious mental health issues have also reported that using cannabis has helped them cope with their illness by helping them feel less anxious or stressed. As in most situations, balancing potential benefits and harms of using cannabis will be key for young people who have serious mental health concerns. \n Mixing drugs, such as cannabis and alcohol, can also increase the possibility of experiencing harms. Intoxication may be more intense and long lasting and the young person may not appreciate how impaired they are. We often suggest, \u201cNot too much, not too often, and only in a safe context\u201d as a simple way to gauge your use of any psychoactive substance. \n As a parent or caring adult, an open respectful relationship with a young person is one of your best resources and ways to prevent harms from substance use. Letting the youth know they can approach you at any time to talk about cannabis, other substances, or anything else of concern to them, says they matter to you and you are ready to listen and engage in dialogue with them. This is a great place to begin addressing anything that might come the young person\u2019s way in life! \n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information. The institute is dedicated to the study of substance use in support of community-wide efforts aimed at providing all people with access to healthier lives, whether using substances or not.

Everyone has mental health, just like everyone has health. As the World Health Organization famously says, \u201cThere is no health without mental health.\u201d In the course of a lifetime, not all people will experience a mental illness, but everyone will struggle or have a challenge with their mental well-being (i.e., their mental health) just like we all have challenges with our physical well-being from time to time. \n When we talk about mental health, we\u2019re talking about our mental well-being: our emotions, our thoughts and feelings, our ability to solve problems and overcome difficulties, our social connections, and our understanding of the world around us. \n A mental illness is an illness the affects that way people think, feel, behave, or interact with others. There are many different mental illnesses, and they have different symptoms that impact peoples\u2019 lives in different ways. \n Health isn\u2019t like an on/off switch. There are different degrees of health. People move on a continuum ranging from great or good health to so-so health to poor health to illness or disability. For example, some people have good health and have no problems going about their lives. Some people experience serious health problems, and their poor health has a very negative impact on their life. Some people have serious health problems that last for a long time, and others have serious health problems that resolve very quickly. Many people fall somewhere in the middle\u2014they\u2019re generally in good health, though the occasional problem may come up. Mental health is the same way. \n Just as someone who feels unwell may not have a serious illness, people may have poor mental health without a mental illness. We all have days where we feel a bit down, or stressed out, or overwhelmed by something that\u2019s happening in our lives. An important part of good mental health is the ability to look at problems or concerns realistically. Good mental health isn\u2019t about feeling happy and confident 100% of time and ignoring any problems. It\u2019s about living and coping well despite problems. \n Just as it\u2019s possible to have poor mental health but no mental illness, it\u2019s entirely possible to have good mental health even with a diagnosis of a mental illness. That\u2019s because mental illnesses (like other health problems) are often episodic, meaning there are times (\u2018episodes\u2019) of ill health and times of better or good health. \n With the right supports and tools, anyone can live well\u2014however they define well\u2014and find meaning, contribute to their communities, and work towards their goals."

On the other hand, \u201cHe is addicted\u201d might mean the speaker thinks the other person is completely unable to control his own behaviour. When people use the word about psychoactive (mind-altering) substances like alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs, they often assume these drugs are dangerous and have the power to control human behaviour. \n The evidence, however, suggests a quite different picture. While substance use can clearly contribute to health and social problems, substances can be beneficial for some people in some situations. Many people celebrate a special occasion with a nice glass of wine, for example. Some people use tobacco as a powerful symbol in cultural and spiritual ceremonies. In fact, substances have been used by humans throughout history for many reasons: to feel good, to feel better, to improve performance, for cultural/spiritual reasons, and to have new experiences. \n Substance use is more complicated than just \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d It\u2019s helpful to think of substance use along a continuum, from beneficial use to harmful use. Along the middle of the continuum, substance use may be both beneficial and harmful. You have an enjoyable night out with friends, but feel a little ill the next day. At the far end of the continuum, some people develop dependence\u2014they need to continually use the drug in order to feel normal and will keep using even when that leads to financial difficulties, problems at home or at work, health problems, or legal problems. \n In general, substance use is a problem when it causes problems for you or others\u2014and how much use causes problems will be different for different people in different situations. The reason a person uses a substance influences the risk of developing problems. For instance, if a person uses a substance to have fun, only occasional social use may follow. But when a person uses a substance to cope with a long-term problem such as social anxiety, then more long lasting and intense use may follow. Managing our risk involves being aware of why we are using and what impacts our use is having on ourselves and those around us.

Getting help doesn\u2019t mean giving up control of shaping your own path. You are still the one who makes the final decisions about the type and degree of change you make. \n One way to get help is to talk to a doctor you trust and feel comfortable confiding in. If you aren\u2019t comfortable talking in person, you can also get advice from a registered nurse (along with advice on programs or services in your area) by calling HealthLink BC at 8-1-1. Since some drugs are illegal, many people worry about what might happen if they talk about drug use. It\u2019s important to know that in most cases, doctors have to protect your privacy\u2014it\u2019s the law. \n In BC, the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service can help you find information on treatment options, support groups and other resources throughout the province. It\u2019s free, confidential, and available 24/7. Call the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service at 1-800-663-1441 or 604-660-9382 in the Lower Mainland."

        "label_text": "Sorting out if you are drinking too much can be complicated. You are unique and your relationship with alcohol is unique. No one has the same combination of life experiences and influences that you do. So even though you and your friend may choose to drink, how and why you use alcohol may be different. \n Those of us who drink, seek benefits from alcohol, not difficulties. But sometimes we start using more, and more often, than makes sense. As a general rule, drinking alcohol becomes a problem when it negatively affects our life or the lives of others. Many people imagine this refers to people who consume alcohol \u201call day every day.\u201d But even drinking too much on a single occasion can lead to a problem, for instance making a poor decision such as driving while impaired. \n What\u2019s also important to recognize is the potential for negative consequences related to drinking in various contexts (i.e., places, times and activities) and over time (e.g., coping with chronic problems). You can get personalized feedback related to your pattern of drinking as compared to Canada\u2019s Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines via the Alcohol Reality Check screening app. This short, simple screen can be used by people of all ages. \n All alcohol use involves some risk. The reasons people use alcohol can influence their risk of developing problems. For instance, if a person uses alcohol to enhance special celebrations, only occasional social use may follow. But when a person drinks to cope with a long-term problem such as social anxiety, then more long lasting and intense use may follow. \n By reflecting on your pattern of drinking you can manage your risk for immediate injury or death, your chances for long-term health consequences such as cancer or heart disease, and your risk of developing habitual patterns of drinking that may lead to these harms. \n Whenever you decide to drink alcohol, it is helpful to know what steps you can take to ensure that your drinking behaviour is the most rewarding and least harmful possible. The following are some useful guidelines to consider. \n Not too much. Managing how much you drink on a given occasion helps decrease risky behaviours. \n Tip: Drink slowly and alternate between non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. \n Not too often. Drinking in moderation helps to reduce harms to ourselves and others over time. \n Tip: Keep less alcohol at home and set limits on how much you are going to drink each week, avoiding drinking on some days. \n Only in safe contexts. Making informed decisions about where you drink helps to minimize alcohol-related harm. \n Tip: If going to a bar, stay with a group and choose an establishment that is well lit and near safe transportation options. \n For information on treatment options and resources throughout BC, call the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service at 1-800-663-1441.

        "label_text": "Cannabis smoke, for example, contains cancer-causing toxins. However, the risk of developing some cancers (e.g., mouth, tongue and lung) is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers, partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. And, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. The negative effects of cannabis on the brain, for example, seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol. \n Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms. The danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it. Cannabis is legal in Canada as of October 17, 2018. Adults (over age 19 in BC) are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public. Cannabis is regulated by the Province of British Columbia and will be sold through the Liquor Distribution Branch. Cannabis will be tested for quality. \n When drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system, it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking. This helps us manage the risks. However, it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system. It is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold, mildew, or fillers that may be toxic. \n The legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. When dealing with complex issues, like cannabis policy, no one has all the answers. But as community members, we all have thoughts, feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. Engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use, as individuals and communities, in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm. \n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

        "label_text": "You can't. But you can influence their capacity to make good choices in a world where alcohol and other drugs are available. It's about helping your child develop the skills to assess what might be helpful in achieving their goals in life. It's also about nourishing a supportive relationship, so they know where to go with questions or problems. \n Opening up a discussion about drugs can help strengthen your relationship with your child. Inviting and allowing open, honest conversation about drugs (or any other subject) makes your child know that what they are thinking, feeling and experiencing matters to you. The goal is to get your child talking and sharing their thoughts and feelings. \n When young people are asked thoughtful, open-ended questions exploring what they think, it helps them become interested in their own thoughts and behaviour. This process of self-reflection is part of developing critical thinking skills, a part of good decision-making. Critical thinking skills are actually an essential part of reducing the risks related to using drugs. Once young people have considered something carefully, they are a lot less likely to act out of impulse or in response to influence. \n There is no rule about how or where a conversation about alcohol or other drugs should start. Even young children know drugs are a part of our culture. They see people drinking around them and are exposed to drugs on TV and in advertising. This makes it a subject that can be brought up naturally while getting ready for a family celebration where alcohol will be present, or if you are planning to visit a relative who uses tobacco, or while swapping stories at the dinner table about what happened at work and school that day. \n Talking with teens and young adults about drugs as they make choices on the path into adulthood helps them to develop personal standards, minimize risks and critically assess popular beliefs about drug use. This can be particularly important as they transition to the legal age for using alcohol or cannabis and move out of the family home. While young adults have more independence and more legal rights, parents can continue to be an important sounding board on which to try out their thoughts and ideas. \n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

        "label_text": "Cannabidiol or CBD is a naturally occurring component of cannabis. It is extracted from the cannabis plant and often made into an oil for use. CBD is not psychoactive, and does not produce the \u2018high\u2019 of THC (tetrahyrocannabinol), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. CBD is legal in Canada and has been used in the treatment of various medical conditions. \n All cannabinoids, including CBD, produce effects in the body by attaching to certain receptors in the brain or immune system. The human body also produces its own cannabinoids. It seems that CBD does not attach directly to receptors. Instead, it directs the body to use more of its own cannabinoids to produce the therapeutic effects associated with CBD. \n Research suggests that CBD may provide relief for chronic pain. Sativex is a proprietary medication that combines THC and CBD and may be prescribed for the relief of pain associated with multiple sclerosis. There is also some evidence suggesting that CBD may be a promising support for people with opioid use disorders. The researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders including anxiety, mood-related symptoms, pain, and insomnia. \n After researching the safety and effectiveness of CBD oil for treating epilepsy, in 2018, the United States FDA approved CBD (Epidiolex) as a therapy for two rare conditions characterized by epileptic seizures. Other evidence suggests that CBD may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, though further research is needed before introducing CBD into medical practice. \n There is some initial evidence that CBD may help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease keep the ability to recognize the faces of people that they know, and thus slow progression of the illness. Again, more research is needed in this area. \n Because of the way cannabis and its products are metabolized, scientists believe there is a potential for interaction with other drugs, although nothing significant has yet been recorded. CBD has been found to be generally safe. Reports from patients indicate that negative drug interactions are not common. As with any other treatment, it is important to monitor your use of CBD and seek assistance if you experience any problems or have questions or concerns about its use. \n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

        "input_text": "what is the evidence on vaping",
        "label_text": "\"Vaping\" is the term for using a device where liquids, often flavoured, are turned into vapour (hence, vaping) and inhaled. A vaping device consists of a mouthpiece, tank or reservoir to hold the liquid, a heating element and a battery to power the element. The liquid is heated to become a mist, inhaled through the mouth into the lungs where the nicotine or cannabis enters the bloodstream. Any residual vapour is exhaled. Vaping devices come in several types, shapes, and sizes, referred to as e-cigarettes, vape pens, vapes, mods, tanks, or e-hookahs. Vaping liquid (e-liquid, e-juice) consists of a solvent, usually propylene glycol or glycerol, flavour, and nicotine or cannabis, though it may not contain anything. In British Columbia you must be 19 years old to buy vaping products. \n The number of young people who smoke cigarettes has declined over the past few years, while vaping has increased. E-cigarettes were developed as an alternative to smoking. The first devices were available in 2003 and looked much like a traditional cigarette. Nicotine vapour contains significantly fewer toxins and other particles than smoke from cigarettes. Vaping is a less harmful alternative to cigarettes and evidence suggests, it may help some people quit smoking. Evidence suggests vaping is likely not a gateway to smoking tobacco. \n Though less harmful than smoking cigarettes, vaping still carries potential harms. There is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapour. (A carcinogen is a substance that has the potential to cause cancer). Some evidence suggests that young people may be unaware the vaping liquid often contains nicotine. E-cigarettes are not controlled and the nicotine content of vaping liquids varies significantly among brands. Other chemicals, flavourings, and heavy metals present in vaping liquids, have not as yet been well studied. Long-term health risks from vaping are thus undetermined. More research is needed in these areas. \n Marketing strategies for vaping products, often on social media, are designed to appeal to young people. The range of flavours available, especially those that are fruity and sweet, and the look and feel of vaping devices attract youth. Young people can see vaping as fun and a way to socialize with friends and 'smoke' in a less harmful way. \n Making the time and space for discussion and exploring the issues around vaping is one important way we can support young people and indeed, each other, in making good decisions about if, when, or how much to vape. We offer, \"not too much, not too often, and in a safe context\" as one way to think about using any substance. What this means to you may be a place for talking to start! \n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

I know that sounds harsh to say but it is the lesson I learned because people on the internet are not going to be nice to you and if you want to survive it you must learn how to not let it get so far under your skin.

Try to graze on small bites throughout the day if a big meal is too much for you, just to get something in you are stomach. Aim for something with decent protein or fiber for energy, do not snack on just lettuce or something. Nuts, nut spreads and crackers, cheese, boiled eggs, veggies and hummus, all great options. And make sure you are replenishing electrolytes and drinking lots of water, the nausea could be from dehydration too. Eat dinner closer to bed time or have a little snack before bed if you are going to bed feeling hungry and waking up sick. You got to honor your body\u2019s needs in order to start feeling better!

I personally have had this happened to me many times, mostly in periods of my life where my anxiety was more heightened.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nOne way to cope with embarrassing memories is to practice self-compassion. This means being kind and understanding towards yourself when you have these thoughts, rather than criticizing or berating yourself. It can also be helpful to remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and has moments they are not proud of. It is not worth thinking too much about those moments, I promise you everyone has had embarrassing moments.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nAnother strategy is to reframe the memory by focusing on the positives. For example, if the embarrassing memory is from a social situation, you might remind yourself of the friendships or connections you made in that situation, rather than dwelling on the specific mistake or embarrassment.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nYou can also try to distract yourself when you find yourself dwelling on an embarrassing memory. Engaging in activities you enjoy can help you build more confidence, and this confidence will counteract or override the feelings of self consciousness over these memories. Focusing your time in and effort on practicing a hobby or doing a pleasant activity is key,  because you will feel better afterwards with yourself too. Personally this is what helped me the most to stop dwelling in awkward memories. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps!"

The whole journey starts with apprehension. As soon as you think about it you have initiated foreplay. When you feel like you have hit the point where you are going to seek it out. Cold shower for 5 minutes. It will reset you. Keep a journal of your retention journey. And if you can go for a month and journal it, you will see how happy you are with your progress. Also think about the money you save. So much growth in so many ways, by simply not giving up your sacred energy. Just my 2 cents."

Maybe this therapist is not telling your parents everything. Your parents may be bringing up things from your therapy sessions due to queues you are unconsciously giving or out of coincidence. I would still strongly consider switching therapists. You should have a therapist that is not a friend of your parents and is outside of the hospital network that your mother works for.\r\n\r\nIf your therapist is a professional, they will keep their emotions out of the equation and encourage you to do what you think is best for your mental health. Even if they are perfectly innocent of what you think might be happening, the fact that you think it is happening is damaging enough to the therapist/patient to warrant finding a new therapist.

You may be lacking dopamine or serotonin. Generally, you will feel unmotivated, sad, sleepy, unfocused and unsocial.\r\n\r\nYou can try talking to a school counselor or therapist if you think you need outside help.

I have not quite figured out this situation, but I was able to break the cycle a couple weeks ago. First, I realized that I was using b/p to stall facing an immense fear of applying for a program. I had to face that underlying fear in order to even come close to breaking the cycle. My therapist had me write down everything I was scared of happening, and sit facing those fears for a while before writing positive outcomes (this helped me a lot). Then, I planned 15 minutes in my day to work on my application and (here is the part that was crucial to me) I HAD TO AVOID TRIGGERS AT ALL COST. Planning was not enough, I still b/p'ed. I literally took $20 in cash to a coffee shop with me, had an accountability buddy check on me when I got there, etc. It was extreme, but I REALLY had to work on this. Everyone is triggers are different, so you may choose different things,  mine is being at home. Finding the courage and discipline to do this is hard, but I took 5 minutes in a neutral zone (i was at work) to plan this all out. Setting timers makes things feel more approachable to me (15 mins to start, 5 mins to plan, etc). You can alwaus do more time, too.\r\n\r\nI am not like \"cured\", i definitely fell off the wagon and stopped working on it. But, your post inspired me reface what worked for me last time, and to start again. Thank you for sharing your story, I hope you find something in mine."

I always get flustered and forget things or minimize my issues when I get there. Having a list in front of you will help you stay on track.\r\n\r\nSecond - you can tell them in the beginning you think it is a problem with your heart and ask them to investigate that. You can request bloodwork and lab work to be done. If I have specific concerns before the appointment, I usually bring it up when I am checking in.\r\n\r\nIF they dismiss your concern and attribute it to weight, you can ask them to write that in the notes. They should document that you think it is a heart problem, they did not investigate, and they think it is your weight. This will usually prompt them to investigate further. If it does not push them to investigate further, ask them if they have a recommendation for a doctor that has experience listening to the patient (this is probably snippy so feel free to re-word as you wish)"

My therapists have provided so much support, refused to give up on me, taught me coping skills to fight depression and anxiety and PTSD (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and EMDR), given me a private place to express myself, taught me how to express myself, always given me objective feedback and advice on my issues, helped me keep my head above the water, helped me keep moving forward, challenged me, given me hope, inspired me, validated my struggles, shown me so much compassion, helped me think more objectively, helped me become much healthier, helped me with the grieving process, helped me be able to leave my home, and showed me that my life is worth living.\r\n\r\n>How often do you normally go?\r\n\r\nI usually go to therapy once a week, but there have been times when I have gone once every two weeks. \r\n\r\n>Does anyone have any legitimate experience with getting a certified letter from your therapist? \r\n\r\nWhile I do not have any experience with this, I know many others who have emotional support animals and service dogs. They were able to get a letter from their doctors without any issue. I think it is definitely worth asking a therapist or your doctor about getting documentation.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you have never been in therapy before and you have any questions (like what types of questions you would be asked by a professional, how to prepare for a first appointment, how first appointments usually go, or my personal experiences with professional help), then do not hesitate to ask me. Feel free to ask anytime!"

I have literally had exes tell me I am the best girlfriend that they have ever had. But there is times that I truly hate myself. There is times that I want to punish myself. Every day really. \r\n\r\nWe are the way that we are for a reason. It does not mean that we do not know what it means to love somebody. It does not mean that we do not understand fidelity. It does not mean that we are not sensitive. It does not mean that we will not make the best friend someone ever had. None of it.\r\n\r\nFrankly, how we feel about ourselves does not even mean that we are bad people. Like all the shit that I do, is to myself. I would rather die then hurt someone else. \r\n\r\nFor me, I just feel like I am too fucked up to ever be with someone. I just do not think the man for me exists. But in no way should you ever feel like you do not have really fucking amazing things to offer just because you have personal issues.\r\n\r\nPeople who say that you have to love yourself before you can love anyone else, are really just ableists who lack the ability to empathize. They are also wrong. I was going to post some links but I figured maybe instead I could suggest to you to search online this subject. Psychology Today has a few articles that I found. If I can find this one source that I think is kind of perfect, I will share. I just have to find it. I remember when I read it, It really spoke to me because I used to think that I had to love myself first. But I only thought that because that is the BS I heard when I was much younger. \r\n\r\nAlso, we should never ever tie our value to what other people think of us.

Try to focus on getting better, beating yourself up about things you cannot control will not help you feel better. Be kind to yourself, you had a crisis and you got the help you needed. I have survived several suicide attempts and I have always felt so badly after for putting my family through that but I was not in my right mind. Now I know when I need more help.

Then have a distraction planned after eating like playing a game, doing a puzzle, talking to a friend, reading, going for a walk, listen to music etc. Distraction can be really helpful when we are dealing with heightened anxiety after eating.\r\n\r\nFinally, set an intention around this food. You can say something to yourself like, \"My intention is to eat this bar and not purge.\" or \"I can trust myself around this food.\" Imagine exactly how you want your interaction with this food to play out. Imagine yourself eating the amount that you want and not engaging in eating disorder behaviors afterwards.

What makes this dietitian so great is that she explains the science behind why we need to eat and what our bodies do with the nutrients and how bulimia affects our bodies. She also counsels me around my behaviours and we look at strategies for managing them. Lastly, she prescribes me a meal plan but we work together to make it with foods I like eating so that it works for me and my lifestyle. \r\n\r\nI think getting a good psychologist as well can be really helpful too. The dietitian will counsel you but they cannot do what a therapist can in terms of looking at deep seated emotional issues and ways of thinking, doing and being. \r\n\r\nI would also recommend finding a good GP who can look after the medical side of things and co-ordinate your care between providers.\r\n\r\nGood luck with your journey, I hope you can build a great team around you to support your recovery."

I started recovering a year and a half ago and it is almost like my brain turned back on and I started feeling disenchanted - I am now dating someone much better suited to me who treats me like a goddess haha, and have not purged in a year and a half. If I never tried to recover I would definitely still be with my ex.\r\n\r\ni guess try not to give up, I did not think I would ever recover but I did and my new partner is so so good to me that I feel like I cannot purge because they deserve better from me.

(In my experience those are two different things, and equally hard to do.)\r\n\r\nBe there, be present, remind her you care about her and want her to experience live with you in the moment. If she does not open up or she refuses to realize her condition- that is all you can do besides raising concern with others to intervene if she does not herself. EDs come with serious health risks. The fact she is telling you these issues with food are in itself a cry for help, so I do not doubt that she is noticing these changes, but it is scary to be seen as needing help. \r\nYou are doing the right thing, but you cannot make her choose recovery or treatment (though you can lead her there with family and her support system if necessary) she has to make that call on her own. \r\n\r\nIt is hard, I know.

It might be helpful to keep lots of snacks around that are easy on your stomach to avoid getting extremely hungry. Try tuning in to your hunger signals as much as you can (timed meals as mentioned in another comment can help with noticing earlier hunger signals). Even thinking about food is an early sign of hunger. \r\n\r\nBinging is typically a response to restricting. So the extreme hunger triggering a binge makes sense. Something else that does not get talked about too often is that mentally restricting (thoughts like \u201cI cannot eat this\u201d or \u201cI should not be eating this\u201d) can actually trigger binge behaviors as well. This can be difficult if you have stomach conditions! (I have IBS and no longer have my gallbladder so I can relate!)\r\nSometimes shifting my mindset toward trigger foods can make a difference for binge behaviors. Choosing between \u201cam I prepared for the discomfort of eating this right now?\u201d can help instead of outright telling myself something is totally off limits. \r\n\r\nHope some of this helps!"

In recent years, evidence for therapeutic breathing has been very encouraging.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nThe self-help I am describing here is not complicated.  \r  \r\n\r  \r\nWhen we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There is two ways to get rid of those thoughts.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nOne is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nWhen you are calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nDo not make mountains out of molehills.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nWhen you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nAlso, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nThe treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.\r  \r\n\r  \r\nDo not overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.\r  \r\n \r  \r\nVideo - a lot of helpful information, including the 3-part program of Brown and Gerbarg -\r  \r\n\r  \r\n\r  \r\n\r  \r\n  Freedom from Self-Harm: Overcoming Self-Injury with Skills from DBT and Other Treatments \r  \r\n\r  \r\nThis book has been endorsed by Marsha Linehan, who created DBT, the best treatment for borderline personality disorder, which has serious self-injury as a frequent symptom. \r  \r\n\r  \r\nThere is a wide variety of treatments. Very severe cases require months of intense therapy but many people do well with a treatment that is just a booklet and a few therapy sessions, usually 2 or 3. \r  \r\n\r  \r\nTreatments that only reduce self-harm are considered successful. The less you self-harm the stronger you are and better able to deal with the problems that led to your self-harm.  Likewise, the better you are in dealing with the underlying problems the more it reduces the self-harm."

Once you are comfortable outside, expand it out further: find a hobby shop, a club you can join, something that will again push you slowly out of your comfort zone, and get you meeting people and socializing. Again, do not be afraid to fail! Try it for a month, if you are not enjoying the experience or the results, try something different. The key is you keep trying new things, really trying to find things you enjoy, but outside your house.  \r\nAgain, do things things, but remember failure is a part of growth. As long as you can try and learn something from your failure, it is okay.  \r\n\r\nHopefully this helps a little bit.

I can imagine what you are experiencing is very mentally taxing. \r\nI like to ask people to imagine their ED as a voice in their head, talking to them and commanding them to do certain things. You are there as well and fighting against it, but sometimes, it wins the argument and you are then forced to do what it says. I am sure part of you wanted to just be normal after your dinner, but your ED (or the beginning of, or whatever you want to call it) ordered you to go count every calorie, and it succeeded in that instance.\r\nI hear that it has not gotten to the point where it is making you adopt purgatory behaviors, but I want you to realize that you have already entered into a phase of restriction. You can look up the binge-restrict cycle if you are not familiar with it. It is not a healthy cycle to be in. Eventually, the ED can become stronger and weaken your own will to stay healthy.\r\nHow to get rid of it ? First, you need to understand that healing from ED is a non-linear process. There will be relapses, and it is normal and it is okay. \r\nYou will also need to build a network around you. ED is not something you can fight on your own. I know it might be hard to even imagine telling people at this point, but the people that really love you will care and be there to support you through this, there is no doubt about that. Allow them to be there for you.\r\n\r\nA good ressource I like to recommend is the book Life without ED by Jenni Schaefer. The author talks about her experience getting rid of her ED. I think it could be a good start for you. You can also look into support groups in your area. They are usually free services offered by non-profits, and you could get to share with people living similar experiences.\r\n\r\nRemember the first step is to acknowledge there is a problem, and you have achieved that already, you can be very proud of yourself. Keep loving yourself, and best of luck :)"

I was at the same spot\u2026 In a span of two weeks, work got so stressful, I did so much coke one night that I could not get out of my room next morning. Had to call in sick. And again. And again. I lost control. I lost the job. \r\n\r\nCocaine addiction can escalate pretty fast. I spent about two years (2015/2016) in heavy addiction. I mean heavy. Four day benders. Almost oded a few times. Nothing made me stop, until I lost my job and it hit me in the face.\r\n\r\nI tried to quit on my own for a while, I spent three months in bed eating and sleeping and fighting the urge to go out and buy more. Then I had a nasty relapse. I only got the grip on recovery when I started seeing a therapist. She helped me get my life back on track.\r\n\r\nSo my tip, from someone that has been in the ups and downs of coke recovery since 2016, is get professional help. Go to a group or get a therapist, or a doctor. It is so much easier and effective when you have someone guiding you. \r\n\r\nBe patient and be strong. It took me several months to stop shaking and feeling dizzy out of the blue. I felt numb and stuck for a long time, until I started going on long morning walks, that really changed everything. Go to bed early, try to go for walks in the sun, lots of sun, eat heathy (but keep ice cream in hand, ice cream is wonderful to cut the cravings) and keep busy during the day. Keep so busy that when party time comes you are so tired, all you want is a good night sleep. You will thank yourself in the morning.\r\n\r\nAlso I had to change all of my friends. I only felt really free from coke in 2021. I almost slipped back during 2020\u2026 Had to let go of all my party people. Up until this day, I do not trust myself around coke, so I avoid people and places where I know there will be blow.  \r\n\r\nThe hardest thing you already did, that is admitting you have a problem. You can do this. Trust me, it is worth it. Life is so much better without cocaine. \r\n\r\nGood luck!!"

You know that little voice in your head that tell you you will fail, there is not enough time, you will get kicked out of school, your parents will be so dissapointed etc etc? I cannot stress this enough, this voice is not you! Just becuase you hear it in your head does not mean it is true. A good method for this is one of my favorites. Imagine for a moment that you are sat on a sofa, and this voice in your head saying all this negativity is another person sat with on on this couch. Listen to them talk. Listen to how they ramble on and on about all this negative stuff. Its getting tiring, annoying and frustrating. So walk away! It sounds silly to some, but making this kind of distinction of \"I am ME and I am NOT my thoughts\" is an incredibly useful tool.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMeditation or self hypnosis - as a hypnotherapist, i may be bias here, but hear me out! Meditation and self hypnosis is an incredible tool to ease mental health and stress issues. There are many guided tools available online, you just have to find one that speaks to you!   \r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this helps you!"

So I understand if anything I say has no merit to you. \r\n\r\nThat starts with healing the hurt (if any) that lead to your addiction to begin with. It is something that my husband is struggling with right now after finding out his son is turning 18th is year. He found out that his(husbands) family abandoned his son too.. husband was not in the right way to take his son (few years ago before he and I the state was trying to get him to take his son) he was in deep with his addiction at the time. He felt it would not be responsible or fair or safe.. (he is kept in contact with son) and now he is battling his own feelings about his family and the SA that occurred as a kid. trying to process his feelings about his son and what to do. (This all trigger a week long binge) All of this to say you got to start the healing at the beginning to get right with yourself in the now. It is going to be hard. Therapy is always a place to start. Now therapy does not work for everyone. (Personal experience through survivors guilt, and dealing with feeling like I lost ten years of my life after ex came out.

        "label_text": "\"I feel really good about myself\"\r\n\r\n\\^ Think of depression, or low points, or however you want to classify it as an issue you can take steps to solve. If you are hungry, what do you do? You eat something. If you are thirsty, you drink, and so on. If you feel low about yourself, you can try to do things that make you feel good about yourself.\r\n\r\nObviously it is not quite that easy, depression is very counterintuitive when it comes down to it. Is there any step of the process that you can do easily? Flossing, mouthwash? Baby steps that can get you into the routine?\r\n\r\nOn that note, the word routine... do you find it easy to form habits? I have heard it takes three weeks to form a habit, but is there a time of day you think you would be comfortable allotting to hygiene stuff? Me personally, I get off work, I shower when I get home. It is just the time I have set to do that, if I do not want to then I do something to force myself to fill a specific shower-sized gap of time. Case in point, if I put something in the oven that will take roughly the length of a shower to cook up for dinner? Well shit, that is not enough time to play a game or watch a show, I might as well just shower while it is cooking. Get out, feel clean, two-for-one because I also feel like I have managed my time well juggling a couple productive things\r\n\r\nPoint is, if you can think of a spot in your day where you tell yourself \"Okay, I can free up a few minutes for this daily\", and take small steps into it, there is potential there to see yourself improving bit by bit. Make a small calendar and tick off which ones you did on a given day and get that little baby dopamine rush seeing the number go from once a week to twice, to three, or who knows what. Seeing it on paper that you are steadily caring for yourself more and more could boost that confidence, it could be as easy as \"I want to do this so I can make that check mark today\"\r\n\r\nKeep your eye on the prize. You felt good about yourself today. Chase that."

What is the worst possible outcome that you might face here? What is the best possible outcome you could achieve? And looking at both of them; is the person you want to be?\r\n\r\nIt would be unusual for you not, from time to time, to have intrusive thoughts. If you are tired, from not enough sleep. Or maybe you are not interacting enough in meaningful relationships with people; your environment really plays a massive role here. Well, it can start to play a trick or two on you. You start to have doubts; \"Oh, just once - what harm can it really do?\" \r\n\r\nSometimes you just have to acknowledge that you are not feeling great about life or some aspects of it. And then just say; \"Okay, so I am feeling / thinking these things. They are just thoughts. I do not need them, so I can let them go.\" And you really can. That is the power you have now; you can make a choice. Sometimes we do not realise how much influence in the outcomes of our lives, and that there is a space for us to make a choice. We can influence our impulses.\r\n\r\nI wish you well. I really do. You made a choice to come and get support. That is shows you have a level of depth and maturity. That you care.

If you do not feel like going to the barber right now and then do not. It is good to expose yourself to uncomfortable situations but you are too uncomfortable do not push yourself. I get a depression beard cuz it is just too much and that is okay. You are appearance should be for you first and foremost. \r\n2) for the therapist, check your insurance and see who is in network. Also see if you have any drug clinics in your area who do mental health; in my area a lot of them do, and in fact my councilor is out of a rehab center and they are great. \r\n3) once you find a therapist, see if they are willing to do telehealth. Since the pandemic providers are now more open to that and your ins should tell you also if they do it as well. Helps to have therapy in a place that makes you comfortable. \r\n4) do not fuck with your medications. If you were running out contact the hospital who prescribed them to see what they can recommend or do. As you experienced a sudden stop of those will make things a lot worse for you; conversely, taking too much is not good either as, at least in my case, some meds can also be muscle relaxers and really mess with you. \r\n5) the doctors and therapists are paid by you to help you. It is their job. They went to school to help people. Let them help you. It will hurt, you may feel like it is bs or it is not for you but you have to stick with it, even though it hurts.\r\nAnd finally:\r\n6) do not stop talking. This is something that I have grown to accept I need to do-keeping what your feeling is not healthy, and I am sure you have friends and family to help. If you do not, you reached out for help here which shows you want to get better so keep talking, work through it, and keep going."

IRD incredibly painful to watch the ones we love do things that hurt us and themselves. \r\n\r\nA few thoughts I have\u2026 \r\n\r\n1. An addict has an addiction that stays with them forever regardless of if they get professional help or not. Professional help (therapist, 12 steps, SMART recovery, treatment program, sponsor, support network, etc) is to develop tools and new coping mechanisms with an aim to increase the likelihood of staying sober. The addiction will always be in the background, that is why guys with 20 years sober still say they got there \u201cone day at a time\u201d. \r\n\r\n2. Do not ask him, because he might deny it and that will make you crazy. Always trust your gut. Tell him you know and do not need to argue or prove you know. Do not give in or give room to negotiate what you know happened. Walk away if you have to and go silent and wait. \r\n\r\n3. Set boundaries, and make sure you are prepared to follow through. Anger or hurt feelings without boundaries does not inspire changed behavior. Boundaries without follow through erase your credibility. Consider things like \u201cI will not be in a relationship with an addict who is not pursuing recovery and following all treatment recommendations\u201d. Or \u201cgoing forward all narcotic medication will be going on a safe only I have the combination to\u201d.\r\n\r\n4. If he will not get help, you can for you, therapy, and alanon /naranon, etc are available for you to help you navigate. \r\n\r\nBest of luck OP."

I started trying to remove the emotion aspect to it and view it simply in terms of my brain and habit. Your brain has created neural networks that lead you to use whatever substance or activity. You have feelings of sadness, you use, feeling of happiness, you use, until eventually your brain feels hardwired to always use. But it is not. When you get those urges, try not to panic or get angry or shamed or anything, try viewing it as a signal being shot through your head. The more you use, the more often you will get those signals. If you view them in that sense I found I had way more power to ignore. And first I would give myself 10 minutes to ignore, and by then the signals had passed and I did not want to anymore. the more you can do that, the stronger you make the neural pathway of \"craving --> stay sober\" . And it builds on itself until your brain redirects more and more easily. At first there will probably be times that you will still follow through with using because it is so habitual at that point, but you can see it as a brain malfunction and not shame yourself \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I am not saying you are not hurting, and that it is simply a bad habit.

Prozac has changed my life recovering from my eating disorder, as my  emotions are generally a lot more regulated as opposed to skyrocketing between highs and lows, so I do not feel the urge to binge or purge like I used to.\r\n\r\nI used to think people were lying when they said EDs were not about weight, but it is true. Whenever I traced back my ED episodes, it often began with stress from schools or sadness about other things, then I would start thinking about my weight and proceed to try to take control (and weirdly, get a dopamine hit) off binging and purging. I would try to be there for her, talk with her, distract her, whatever she wants to do when she is feeling those emotional lows- hopefully getting her mind far away enough from feeling an urge to binge and purge. But ultimately, no one can or should be held responsible for every second of someone is life, so know that it is not your fault if/when these episodes happen anyways.\r\n\r\nSort of a side note but I would avoid making comments about her body for the most part. Even well intended comments about looking healthy can send someone with an ED into a spiral (associating healthy with gaining weight, then feeling a need to compensate). And comments about looking slim can make people with EDs feel excited and make them think they should keep up what they are doing.\r\n\r\nI hope your girlfriend is willing to talk open up about these issues to you, and if she is, you should ask her what you can do to help her with this and encourage her to seek treatment again if need be. I am glad you are trying to help her, and I hope that you are easy on yourself as EDs are incredibly difficult to understand, and ultimately, you cannot make someone break those habits; they have to choose to."

A nurse at a mental hospital (!!!) telling a patient to basically kill themselves is highly unprofessional. If the hospital does not actually take any action, that absolutely needs to be reported. The fact that he told you to be quiet means he knows he did something that could get him in trouble.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I think staff (therapists included) treating patients unfairly is not rare. I do think you should still report it.

I have seen over a dozen in the past 35 years and i can say that, like with anything else, there is a very wide gamut. For example, I once had a new therapist that I asked, \"What do you think I should do\", and her answer was, \"Why are you giving me all the power.\" I walked out thinking it was weird, but I went back once more. By the end of the second visit I decided she was not for me. So I left and tried someone else.  I have also had some great experiences. One therapist I saw once a week for over a year, that is what...50-60 sessions? I liked her the way she communicated, and I grew a ton through the work I did with her.   \r\n\r\n\r\nTherapists are just people, each with their own quirks, strengths, weaknesses, etc. You really do have to shop around and it takes time. I will make a list of 5-6 options and call each one of them. They take a bit to call you back but eventually you get 5 minutes or so on the phone to see how they feel. This has worked for me well. And go easy on this process. Anyone seeking therapy is usually suffering to some degree, and its normal to feel impatient at the beginning.  \r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding your reddit comment.

A co-worker of mine ended up becoming a very good friend and she has her own mental health issues she struggles with. One day I had my attitude drop to the floor and she instantly noticed, she then went on break, bought me a joint and a little snack, came back and sent me on my lunch. I clocked out went into the bathroom and cried for about 10 minutes because I could not believe someone had done something so nice for me, it had been so long. It had nothing to do with the items she gave me and had everything to do with the fact that she cared. She cared enough to at least try and make me happy and that meant everything to me. It is not that my family has never tried these things but my family is also fed up with my downs.

        "label_text": "first off, it is really healthy to express what you are going through here. depression often convinces us expressing is pointless because it will not change anything. but when we express, we are validating our emotions by showing them instead of hiding them away because of shame, fear, or worthlessness. i appreciate you reaching and being open. it helps other people too to when we see each other's pain and struggles.\r\nI am in my 40s and my brain still tries to convince me daily it would be better to just die and i love so much of my life. not a day has gone by when some minor thing has not made me think about it. i attempted twice in my late teens and when i was 20 but did not work. I am grateful some days and some days i wish i had died. most days, i do not have strong feelings about it either way. \r\nwhat I have learned about depression through years of witnessing it is this - we are not our minds. the mind is like a tape recorder or movie constantly showing us \"who we are\" but really, we are the one witnessing the movie (the thoughts, feelings of our body). we are not the feelings or thoughts. we cannot control the feelings or thoughts. they just come at us and we are the ones that have to witness them and deal with them. when they hit us super hard, we cannot handle them and want to escape them. when they are not hitting us hard, we want to avoid ever dealing with them again. our mind acts like a computer to come up with solutions. since it cannot solve feelings and thoughts from happening, it is always uses death as this shortcut solution. suicde is ambition for change when our limited history-based minds cannot see any other possibilities. but we can never see the future. we only see what we imagine the future to be based on the past. thoughts and thinking are only good for preparing us to get from point a to point b. if we try to use thinking to \"solve\" our emotions, the best it can come up with is \"you are here so try going there\". people just keep running from point a to point b and back again trying to avoid having difficult emotions. they get exhausted from all this running around and think \"nothing works. i cannot shake theses awful feelings\". boom. depression. we cannot control our feelings or our thoughts. all we can do is try to respond to them calmly. feelings are the body's way of pointing us to a need. some of these needs are physical, like food, physical comfort, etc. some are emotional like connecting to other people (as the last lines in your post seem to indicate), feeling valid, feeling worthy, feeling useful, feeling seen and heard. feelings can also arise strongly when our boundaries are being pushed. i do not want to write a whole book here but the big picture is life is always either the best moment of your life or the worst moment of your life because with every step we take, we carry all the previous moments with us. we never get free from that but we can learn to forgive ourselves for what we cannot control, to forgive ourselves for what we have done and what was done to us. as we develop the ability to forgive by being able to face our terrifying past with stillness and calm, the moments of our past get lighter so we can witness right now with less weight and less clouded vision. i should say people do not often understand what forgiveness is. to me, it is not absolving anyone from responsibility or condoning the actions. forgiveness is accepting what happened because whatever happened did so because someone was acting from insecurity - insecurity causes people to try and control, manipulate, hurt or steal. insecurity spreads like a virus when it touches someone else. forgiveness is the attempt to say \"i will not continue to spread the insecurity that was placed on me\".\r\none last thing to consider is stress. we cannot avoid stress because we are under pressure all the time. gravity holds us down. our lungs and heart have constant pressure. stress is all the time but if you think about how \"fun\" happens, it only happens when we voluntarily participate in doing stressful things. if we always feel a victim to stress, we never enjoy it. when we do things knowing they will be stressful but voluntarily participate, we actually find benefits. you might be going through a lot of stress right now so it is important to figure out how what stress you are voluntarily taking on and what stress you are convincing yourself to do involuntarily. unfortunately, since you are still under age, you will have to deal with lots of forced stress. it is not permanent though. and getting a job is not going to be the same kind of stress you are dealing with now because work brings purpose, not just stress. you do not have to become your parents, even though their influence is a part of you. you do not have to have it all figured out at any age. i still do not have it all figured out. I have had more jobs and more relationships than anyone i know but i keep getting better at saying no to stress i do not want and yes to stress i do. that to me is what getting better looks like. best of luck if you made it all the way through these ramblings. I am always here if you need more clarification."

Music helps me make sense of what I am feeling. Singing helps me release the heavy feelings trapped within. I have had times when I have felt so alone, so numb, and craved a release. I belt the right song for that moment and I can feel the emotion release. I have a very hard time crying, but in these moments I feel tears build up. That is when I know it is working. It is the same relief I have felt after cutting myself. It is important to let out the pain in a healthy way. Lean into your musical interests. Find the music that helps you feel that relief.

You appear to be an introspective person, who communicates well, and who is in touch with their emotions. This is unique in itself. The desire to give yourself to others is a virtue not a vice. Unfortunately we live in a culture that is obsessed with the self. We think that making ourselves \u201chappy\u201d is a proper life goal. I tried that, it does not work for very long. I put myself first always. I sought wealth, power, pleasure and honor. Sometimes I achieved some of this, and it made me happy for only short periods. I found true peace in seeking meaning in life. Someone said that we can spend our entire life asking \u201cwho am I\u201d? But the proper question is \u201cfor whom am I\u201d? You are a truly unique creation. You have all sorts of thoughts, emotions, talents, and charisms that are meant to be shared with those around you. You must care for yourself so that you can develop all of your unique gifts, but then you need to share those gifts, and that often means putting the self last. There was a priest named Maximilian Kolbe who was in a Nazi concentration camp. Prisoners had been selected for execution. He had been spared, but he took the place of a condemned prisoner who was worried about who would care for his family after his death. He put himself last. He willed the destruction of himself to rise above the self and to become truly free. He transcended self. To me that is a hero. His meaning in life was service to others right up to the point of his death. Get to know yourself. Develop all of your gifts to your fullest ability (and believe me, you will discover that you have considerable gifts once you really look). But then share those gifts. You will find the greatest meaning and peace in being of service to others. Life is extremely challenging for ever creature on this planet. By reaching out and helping each other we can find peace and meaning in our existence. May God bless you on your journey."

My anxiety and depression kill my appetite and make it very hard to eat anything.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have found it helps to try and keep a consistent meal schedule. Three meals a day, even if those meals are small. Just having a routine is helpful. You do not have to worry too much about healthy food. If junk food is the only thing you can stomach, go with that. Take advantage of any cravings you have. I get nauseous when I eat too, but there are some foods that do not make me feel quite as sick. Try and find what foods those are for you and stock up on them. Try eating a few bites more than you want to at every meal. It is uncomfortable but slowly it grows your appetite and you will be able to eat more food without feeling as sick. \r\n\r\nAnxiety and depression can stop you from gaining weight. I was having daily anxiety attacks and according to my doctors, I was burning calories because I was so anxious. My heart races when I am anxious to the point that it is basically cardio. I was down to 89 pounds and I was terrified of dropping more weight because I was so unhealthy. Once I started medication for my anxiety (80mg propranolol) my appetite came back and my body could maintain weight. I am also on antidepressants which often because weight gain as a side effect, which for you and I can be extremely positive. I am a healthy weight now and feel much better. I know lots of people have plenty of reservations about taking medication, but if you still cannot gain weight it might be something to look into. Good luck, friend :) you can DM me if you have any questions."

It is not a magic cure, but most patients find the right medication for them within the first four medications that they try.\r\n\r\nYou may encounter resistance when suggesting that your boyfriend get help. Depression has a way of putting thoughts into a person\u2019s head, and the fact that he is pushing you away means that those thoughts are winning. You need to convince him that he has a real medical problem that deserves real medical treatment.\r\n\r\nYour presence in your boyfriend\u2019s life is helping him more than you know. If he gets isolated, he may spiral down a depressive path that could potentially cost him everything. Social support is very important to people who suffer from depression, and texts and calls can be a lifeline to someone who is trapped in a depressive episode.\r\n\r\nOther things that can help him include having him start exercising regularly (it is good for his brain!) and make sure he hangs out with friends.\r\n\r\nNot to catastrophize, but if your boyfriend ever feels suicidal, make sure he has the number for a suicide hotline or crisis center and for a nearby mental hospital, just in case he needs it."

        "label_text": "Do you mean pharmacological or behavioral.\r\n\r\nLiterally every mood stabilizer and neuroleptic/antipsychotic drug reduces emotional intensity\u2014lithium, lamotrigine, seroquel, oxycarbozepine, and to some extent antidepressants, although to a much less extent, hence why bipolar people or people with PTSD or borderline personality syndrome are not stable in A/D\u2019s alone. You might say that anxiolytic drugs reduce emotional intensity as well (e.g. clonazapam is used to treat mania or relapses to mania).\r\n\r\nMany of the anxiolytics are essentially sedatives or tranquilizers (alprazolam, diazepam), but there is a ton of atypical ones that are used off label that are not hugely sedating\u2014clonidine and guanfacine to list a few. Some of the tranquilizers (generally benzodiazepines since older ones like the barbiturates are even more dangerous) are not hugely sedating but will always have some sedating effect since they work to increase gamma-aminobutyric acid, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in your brain. Alcohol also does this and it is why it reduces social anxiety but please do not go down that path.\r\n\r\nNeuro-Behaviorally it would be along the lines of meditation, breathing exercises, cognitive behavioral therapy (depends to what extent your weddedness to certain fixed beliefs is emotional for you), and other whole body oriented with mindfulness component practices such as martial arts, yoga, and tai chi.\r\n\r\nI would also suggest that a structured writing practice can diffuse the triggers that nudge you towards excessive emotional intensity. I think this is a part of dialectical behavioral therapy which was invented to treat a borderline personality, a condition notorious for erratic emotional fluctuations of high intensity.\r\n\r\nI personally use all of these strategies. Pharmacologically I take lithium and clonazapam, methylphenidate and bupropion, but it is questionable how much the latter two address emotional instability and intensity.  In theory methylphenidate (aka Ritalin) *should* but at the same stimulants can induce emotional instability.\r\n\r\nI follow a structured writing practice that is pragmatically oriented that I use to defang the weight or severity of life situations triggers etc. All that said I still suffer severe fluctuations towards very intensive negative emotions involving rage and suicideality. I actually requested due to this fact because I know where it leads to otherwise.\r\n\r\nI am in a life situation (2 years foreclosure) that is highly triggering to me and I think the stimulant and antidepressant I use can feed into unstable emotions (methylphenidate/ bupropion). At the same time My blood pressure is pretty high probably due to circumstantial and possibly pharmacological factors (both the Ritalin and the welbutrin can increases blood pressure) so am looking to initiate guanfacine or clonidine to replace them. \r\n\r\nI was given a single clonidine pill in the doctors office because my blood pressure was critically high and I have never felt calmer in my recent memory.\r\n\r\nIn any case I hope this helps and I wish you all the best. It is a day to day struggle. There are no silver bullets no magical therapies or gurus that have a simple solution for emotional regulation."

Look at the requirements that the job is asking for and what is \"preferred but not required.\" \r\n\r\nYou will not be intending to apply for said job right now at the current moment if there major things you still need like a bachelor's or associates, or a certification/trade license or whatever. But you can reverse engineer goals by seeing what the current job market requires and try comparing similar job listings for other companies and places to get a realistic grasp to get there. You may find that you will not need a bachelor's for \"xyz\" job and it would only require something that is far easier to obtain than trying to force yourself to get through college.\r\n\r\nOur generations kind of been implanted with the belief that we all have to \"work a job that is our passion\" or \"love what you do and do what you love.\" But some people may never find a job or work that actually fills them with \"joy\" no matter how long they keep trying different things. They might realize that all job work itself is boring af and the only happiness and pleasure they get can be from relationships and personal life things outside or work. And they just have to find a job that is easiest to put up with and has the least tradeoffs while also making sure that job is enough to make a living on in this already economic messed up world.\r\n\r\nBiowaste Cleanup Crew (cleans dead bodies or dead animals from public areas and in homes etc) can pay a shit ton $50 an hour??, but that can fuck your head permanently seeing normal people turned to bloody unrecognizable messes.\r\n\r\nWaste management/ trashcan collecting/etc: a reddit post once talked about how you can make decent good money off that. Just have earphones listening to music all day and drive the truck/pick things up quickly and you do not have to put up with people's bullshit like in retail/food jobs. You should check it out I think the post was somewhere in R/askreddit \"what kind of job can an unskilled uneducated person get that can provide a comfortable living for the rest of their life?\" So many good answers.\r\n\r\nI work in the music education world where most musicians are either regular teachers or are travelling performers doing gigs in random far away places and doing church music work even if you are atheist. Music teachers do not exactly get paid a whole lot but if they have a deep desire and love for working with kids then it is worth it to them. It is also been a common thing that some musicians train getting an education degree and after working in the real thing realize working with kids sucks ass and then change their careers to doing professional music but working only with adults. \r\n\r\nI was in the same boat with college I took a 3 year gap away from college to take a mental break and work on my depression/ptsd/insomnia health problems so I can be in \"better shape\" when I return to school. I came back and did everything I could have best way I can and it was not enough I just am too depressed and have too many health issues in academic environments where I am the student. I realized that yes I would love to finish this damn degree that I have spent 6 years on already because I know I will have less of a hard time in the future getting decent jobs with this qualification. But I cannot spend another 2 or 3 years in college, no amount of extended deadlines or accommodations helps me and I had to decide to drop out of college permanently for my own health. I feel a huge weight has lifted off my shoulder despite my initial feelings of disappointment and shame, and I think I am better off not fucking my health up anymore and finding different ways to get to where I want.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you are unsure about what you want in life or what job or do not know if you will be unhappy all your life, you have to keep trying different things and if you still feel unhappy you have to find out if it is a temporary life setback you can push through and eventually feel better about or if it is something that you need to stop and try something else entirely. The only way you will find out is to keep trying. And you have to work on the life skill of being able to know who you are as a person and have a healthier sense of identity to better grasp what those gut feelings are  when you are trying things but unsure if you stay or move on. Some people it takes them decades to figure themselves out but remember this is your journey.\r\n\r\nThere is not a right or wrong choice, there is just a choice you make hoping it will bring you the most happiness doing so or the least discontentment out of every other option. \r\n\r\nAlso everytime I tell an adult or therapist my life situation and rough time changing career goals they say \"you are only 24? Man you are still really young and got a whole life ahead of you do not even worry about feeling like you wasted your 20s\" \ud83e\udd21"

I Do Not Know how this sounds, because going about it this way is not cool on her end (and this might not even be your concern) but if she does just want you to care, she clearly values the care you give her and sees you as someone who is attention she desires as she struggles. \r\n\r\nLike I know this might not change anything, but I do not think she is losing weight and feeling better than you or something.

        "label_text": "\"Compulsive\" lying is a maladaptive coping skill people learn, not a mental disorder. People lie like this when they are taught as kids that telling the truth is not safe and will not get them what they want, or will get them taken advantage of or hurt. Especially when there are narcissists around. And the second factor is when kids are \"seen and not heard\" and never taught to self-advocate or assert themselves.\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to \"fix the lying\" fix the reasons. Practice assertiveness, asking for what you want, maintaining boundaries, saying NO, and negotiating when faced with people asking you to do things you do not want to do or not giving you what you want. These are SKILLS that you can learn that are effective replacements for these kinds of lies.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion; going to a psych prison where you are going to have NO control, do not get to say no to anything, and do not get to ask for what you want is only going to reinforce the negative beliefs that make you feel like you have to lie. There is likewise no benefit to medication for this problem. Both of these suggestions strike me as \"you are broken so go do the thing I saw on TV and get fixed for my comfort\" rather than \"research.\"\r\n\r\nOne boundary I would start to set- stop letting your healthcare decisions be a \"we.\" **You** decide what treatment, therapy etc to pursue, and with who, and how, and when. When other people stick their nose across that line- Listen to what they have to say if you respect their opinion, and then tell them \"No.\" Even if you think they are doing it because they care, how it makes you feel shows through when you lie to evade it."

        "label_text": "Sorry in advance, this is long\r\n\r\nThere are a few things that come to mind, and please keep in mind that I am in no position to asses or diagnose anything. You should make an appointment with a mental health professional when you can, to discuss these things and look into further options. I know you said that is not an option right now, but it is worth noting there are some things that only they can help with (especially regarding medications and such). If you are not sure where to go, talk with your GP/PCP about wanting to get established with therapy or something along those lines. If you feel comfortable going into detail with that person though, some practitioners can prescribe medications for mental health as well\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, there are a couple things that come to mind. First, regarding the subject of those actions, it might be worth looking into your current diet and making sure you are not deficient in any vitamins. Vitamin deficiencies can create unusual cravings and unexpected behavior changes. If so, diet is the best way to get those vitamins, but supplements can also be used (just do not take more than the recommended amount, because you can overdose on vitamins as well). You can also talk to your doctor in the future about blood testing (metabolic panel) to determine more definitively where you are at with those things as well\r\n\r\nThe other things that come to mind are more mental health focused. But not in a \u201cit is all in your head\u201d way, rather, in a \u201cthese might be specific challenges you are facing\u201d way. Very broadly speaking, it sounds like you may be dealing with compulsions (\u201cdo this thing or something bad will happen\u201d), especially given that you find it near impossible to control them. I do not know about these, so I do not want to speak where I lack information, but it may be worth looking into more on your own, or with a professional \r\n\r\nThe other thing that could be a factor (again, not a professional and I cannot say with certainty) is some level of dissociation. Dissociation is a disconnect between various aspects in experiences. This can include thoughts, emotions, memory, and even disconnecting from your own body or the world around you (depersonalization/derealization respectively). That \u201cwatching yourself do things from the back seat\u201d feeling is one I am very familiar with, having a dissociative disorder myself. Dissociation is not always disordered though, I should note. Everyone dissociates some in their lives. If you have ever read the same paragraph over a few times without understanding it, or forgotten the car ride home, those are examples of non-harmful dissociation \r\n\r\nBecause what you are describing sound like it is distressing and impacting your life negatively, it is not my first thought that it is a normal level of dissociation. However, that does not mean it is disordered either. If you deal with a lot of stress or anxiety (which can also be tied to compulsions), that may be a factor, especially if you have been dealing with that more recently before these experiences. This is also true if you have a history of prolonged stress or trauma, or if emotions are difficult to handle. Dissociation is a common coping skill for those things\r\n\r\nAll of this is to say that these can be normal experiences. Not necessarily average or common, but completely understandable and a normal human experience in the right circumstances. You are not alone. Even if there are different causes, you are not \u201ccrazy\u201d (few people who worry about being crazy actually are)\r\n\r\nIf you look into these things on your own, you may come across things like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or Dissociative Identity Disorder. This does NOT mean you have these things, just that there is symptom overlap. But just as I would sooner assume a sneeze is a cold and not cancer (even if that is a distinct possibility), I would not jump the gun on all of the possibilities\r\n\r\nFor now, the strongest recommendation I can give is to focus on managing stress (try looking up grounding techniques), see if your diet is lacking in anything, and keep a log/journal about these experiences, especially as they do (or do not) relate to changes stress or anxiety. This way, you have documentation for yourself, but also to show any professionals if you take the step of setting appointments. It can help to identify patterns or triggers, and how to more forward from there\r\n\r\nBest of luck, and my DMs are always open if you need to talk"

Fortunately, I was able to reconnect with people after depressive episodes ended, and the episodes became less frequent once that I got professional help. Your friend may reach out to you. If they open up about being depressed, or other mental health issues, you could encourage them to talk to their doctor or a mental health professional.
