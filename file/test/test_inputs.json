Music therapy - youtube or spotify relaxing and calming music to help you reduce your heart rate and calm your breathing if your anxiety gets bad. Take your time with it. Journal - write down your anxious thoughts. what worries you the most, is anything else bothering you, are you catastrophizing? Talk it out - do you have a family member, friend or classmate that would be willing to listen to you vent and air your concerns? Therapy - if its within finanical reason, consider speaking to a therapist Dissociation - I love using this technique. You know that little voice in your head that tell you you will fail, there is not enough time, you will get kicked out of school, your parents will be so dissapointed etc etc? I cannot stress this enough, this voice is not you Just becuase you hear it in your head does not mean it is true. A good method for this is one of my favorites. Imagine for a moment that you are sat on a sofa, and this voice in your head saying all this negativity is another person sat with on on this couch. Listen to them talk. Listen to how they ramble on and on about all this negative stuff. Its getting tiring, annoying and frustrating. So walk away It sounds silly to some, but making this kind of distinction of \"I am ME and I am NOT my thoughts\" is an incredibly useful tool. Meditation or self hypnosis - as a hypnotherapist, i may be bias here, but hear me out Meditation and self hypnosis is an incredible tool to ease mental health and stress issues. There are many guided tools available online, you just have to find one that speaks to you. I hope this helps you"

        "output_expected": "It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background. Although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children. Additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition. Parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their child's mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs)."

My partner is an endurance athlete and has been increasing his training intensity, frequency, etc. It is happened a handful of times now where, around meal time, he will reference how many calories he burned per his app or whatever he uses to program his workouts. For context, he references calories in this context like, \u201cI am ready to eat because I am so unusually hungry, which makes sense because I apparently burned x calories during my workout\u201d. He is aware of my ED history and has been supportive so far. I want to ask him not to talk about calories in front of me because it is honestly triggering. That said, I do not know how to approach this conversation or if it is even fair of me to make this request. TIA for any advice or support.",

Since he knows about your ED history I am sure he will understand and refrain from speaking about calories around you.

I need to increase my food intake 3. My intake and exercise are not adding up, I will need to make a few adjustments to my diet/gym routine All these examples replace the need to mention calories or a numeric value. I hope this helped."

We have been through a lot and I adore him. He is not a bad human, he is a hard working beautiful human that is struggling. Last night I took a drink from a water bottle in my car, that he had bought that day - it tasted like chemicals and I felt strange after. Upon asking him, he denyed anything (maybe It was in my head). I got an at home drug test kit this morning and tested the bottle/ water. It tested positive for opioids and methadone. I confronted him and he said he f'd up.. I do not know what to do.. it is the looking me in the eyes and lying.. I feel like such a fool. We are actively trying to conceive.. I am feeling numb as it is just a repeat cycle of dishonesty. The trust is broken. I do not know who to turn to for support.. for either of us. I have attended appointments with his doctor, I did not think opioids were supposed to have an affect when on the injections.. that taking drugs were pointless. I do not know what to do anymore.. I am exhausted by it.. and I am fully aware he is too.",
