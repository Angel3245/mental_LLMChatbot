"Is it fair to ask may partner if he can refrain from talking about calories? My partner is an endurance athlete and has been increasing his training intensity, frequency, etc. It is happened a handful of times now where, around meal time, he will reference how many calories he burned per his app or whatever he uses to program his workouts. For context, he references calories in this context like, “I am ready to eat because I am so unusually hungry, which makes sense because I apparently burned x calories during my workout”. He is aware of my ED history and has been supportive so far. I want to ask him not to talk about calories in front of me because it is honestly triggering. That said, I do not know how to approach this conversation or if it is even fair of me to make this request. TIA for any advice or support.","It is understandable why this could be triggering for you. It might be helpful to have a conversation with your partner about how his comments are affecting you and why they are difficult to hear. You could also suggest alternative ways he could refer to his workouts, such as by mentioning how he feels or what he accomplished instead of focusing on calories. Ultimately, it is up to your partner to decide whether or not he wants to change his language, but it would be beneficial for both of you to discuss the impact of his comments.</s>",0.35,0.28
"I need advice on how to approach my depressed girlfriend. I am seeing her tonight for the first time in a few days. Last time I saw her, I noticed her teeth were unclean, to the point there was physical build up on them. She is my girlfriend, so obviously she is going to want a kiss, but I highly doubt she is brushed them since then. If that is the case, what is the best way to tell her I do not want to kiss her if she has not brushed her teeth in weeks? I need to set my hygienic boundaries but I do not want to offend her or make her feel bad and judged.","As a mental health expert, it is important to be mindful of your own boundaries and prioritize your own wellbeing. It might be helpful to start by expressing your concern about her physical hygiene in a gentle and supportive manner. You could say something like “I noticed your teeth looked a bit dirty last time we met, and I wanted to check in with you to see if you are okay and if you have had a chance to take care of that.” This allows you to address the issue without making her feel bad or judged. If she is open to it, you can also suggest ways to take care of her teeth that are within your comfort level, such as suggesting a dentist visit or offering to help her find resources for taking care of her teeth at home.</s>",0.23,0.27
"Partners drug test kit was positive. I am seeking advice. My partner of 10 years has always struggled with addiction. Heroin in the past, opioids and benzos etc. He is currently getting monthly buvidal (Buprenorphine) injections at his doctor.. I have been trying to support him as much as I can. We have been through a lot and I adore him. He is not a bad human, he is a hard working beautiful human that is struggling. Last night I took a drink from a water bottle in my car, that he had bought that day - it tasted like chemicals and I felt strange after. Upon asking him, he denyed anything (maybe It was in my head). I got an at home drug test kit this morning and tested the bottle/ water. It tested positive for opioids and methadone. I confronted him and he said he f'd up.. I do not know what to do.. it is the looking me in the eyes and lying.. I feel like such a fool. We are actively trying to conceive.. I am feeling numb as it is just a repeat cycle of dishonesty. The trust is broken. I do not know who to turn to for support.. for either of us. I have attended appointments with his doctor, I did not think opioids were supposed to have an affect when on the injections.. that taking drugs were pointless. I do not know what to do anymore.. I am exhausted by it.. and I am fully aware he is too.","As a mental health expert, I would advise you to seek individual counseling for yourself to process your feelings about the situation.

"Is it appropriate to request that my partner refrain from bringing up calories? My partner has been upping the volume, frequency, and other aspects of his training. He has mentioned how many calories he expended according to his app or whatever he uses to schedule his workouts a few times recently, usually around mealtime.

"How should I approach my depressed girlfriend? I need advice. Tonight is the first time I've seen her in a few days.

In the past, heroin, opioids, benzos, etc. He currently receives monthly injections of buvidal (buprenorphine) from his physician. I've been doing everything I can to help him. Since the circle of dishonesty is just repeated, I am feeling numb. Trust has been betrayed. For either of us, I am unsure of who to turn to for help.
