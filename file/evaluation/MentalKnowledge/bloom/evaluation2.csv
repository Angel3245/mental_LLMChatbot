"What is mental health?
",A mental health diagnosis of a mental health condition is a legal document that provides advice on how to best treat such conditions.
"What should I do if I am worried about a friend or relative?
","If you want to talk to someone about something serious, such as your friend or relative you have to tell them so, you can do this in advance and ask them if they need to talk to them before you tell them about something serious, so they can just tell them. You can be flexible with them and ask for them to come to you in advance. If you don’t have a friend or relative, you will have to make a phone call for them when they d'inversió the situation. For example, if your friend or relative is worried about the conversation, you will ask them before they even come out, so it can really help. You do not have to tell them your friend or relative to be worried about the conversation, but this can help you to know your friend and how to help them. If you feel comfortable talking about something serious, or think it is a great idea to be there, it એને in their hand to talk to you, and their mind is in their hand to do the same. I hope this helps."
"Is it fair to ask may partner if he can refrain from talking about calories? My partner is an endurance athlete and has been increasing his training intensity, frequency, etc. It is happened a handful of times now where, around meal time, he will reference how many calories he burned per his app or whatever he uses to program his workouts. For context, he references calories in this context like, \u201cI am ready to eat because I am so unusually hungry, which makes sense because I apparently burned x calories during my workout\u201d. He is aware of my ED history and has been supportive so far. I want to ask him not to talk about calories in front of me because it is honestly triggering. That said, I do not know how to approach this conversation or if it is even fair of me to make this request. TIA for any advice or support.
",Do not make a request about the calories. Do not get him to tell you how much he has consumed to burn.
"I need advice on how to approach my depressed girlfriend. I am seeing her tonight for the first time in a few days. Last time I saw her, I noticed her teeth were unclean, to the point there was physical build up on them. She is my girlfriend, so obviously she is going to want a kiss, but I highly doubt she is brushed them since then. If that is the case, what is the best way to tell her I do not want to kiss her if she has not brushed her teeth in weeks? I need to set my hygienic boundaries but I do not want to offend her or make her feel bad and judged.
",I do السكر.
"Partners drug test kit was positive. I am seeking advice. My partner of 10 years has always struggled with addiction. Heroin in the past, opioids and benzos etc. He is currently getting monthly buvidal (Buprenorphine) injections at his doctor.. I have been trying to support him as much as I can. We have been through a lot and I adore him. He is not a bad human, he is a hard working beautiful human that is struggling. Last night I took a drink from a water bottle in my car, that he had bought that day - it tasted like chemicals and I felt strange after. Upon asking him, he denyed anything (maybe It was in my head). I got an at home drug test kit this morning and tested the bottle/ water. It tested positive for opioids and methadone. I confronted him and he said he f'd up.. I do not know what to do.. it is the looking me in the eyes and lying.. I feel like such a fool. We are actively trying to conceive.. I am feeling numb as it is just a repeat cycle of dishonesty. The trust is broken. I do not know who to turn to for support.. for either of us. I have attended appointments with his doctor, I did not think opioids were supposed to have an affect when on the injections.. that taking drugs were pointless. I do not know what to do anymore.. I am exhausted by it.. and I am fully aware he is too.
",We need to talk and help him out with what we variasi of actions that he can take for him to function better. His doctors are the ones that will handle this. I would say we are going to want to work on his life in a way we can do for him to make the most out of it.
"I have a final exam soon but I have mental health problems. What should I do?
","I do not think you have a good time. I am so sure that that would help. But I think that everyone has had a good time until then. The only thing you should not do is have a fear of the day. And then use that to prepare for the next day. I think this is common. But if you are not able to take care of yourself without a therapist, it is important to do it."
"Which types of people are affected from a mental disorder?
",This is more common for people with depression and stress and is a mental illness
"Which treatments could I receive?
",Unfortunately some therapists do not actually work with people with mental illnesses. Talk to a professional therapist.
"Where should I look for a therapy group?
","If you are searching for support, you can visit a few online resources that can be used. Some help you find a team of counselors who子在 similar communities and find the right program or other resources to use for your needs. They are usually more about helping people with mental health issues to themselves than they have a professional."
"Describe mental health.
",It is important to understand what you are doing and what the mental health benefits of medication are.
"What could I do if a friend or family member has my concern?
","You could ask the family member to talk to them, or even find a professional in the community who will be with you in a year to help you find new people and start new things. They can then take the time to discuss what they think they can be, and if they cannot reach you before the week, call your local library to ask for help. Ask for a list of things that you have to write to make sure the person you want to talk with can understand the situation. You may be surprised how much people have their concerns listed on the website. The most common concerns that a family member and friends has to write to include is that they may get a lot of messages on their phone while their friend is alone or is alone with friends or family members, and that they may get very difficult memories of childhoods that they did not have in life or that they have a great childhood and that they may have serious problems for themselves. They can still get messages through the same way. If it seems like you have a problem or need someone to talk to, call the nearest librarian."
"Is it appropriate to request that my partner refrain from bringing up calories? My partner has been upping the volume, frequency, and other aspects of his training. He has mentioned how many calories he expended according to his app or whatever he uses to schedule his workouts a few times recently, usually around mealtime. He is aware of my past with eating disorders and has so far shown support. Since talking about calories in front of me is actually triggering, I want to ask him to refrain. Having said that, I'm not sure how to start this conversation or even if my request is reasonable. TIA for any assistance or counsel.
","I do not want to make too much effort on him. I just wanted to say, that you are being honest and that you are not a burden on him, it is up to you to take care of him as someone-minutes."
"How should I approach my depressed girlfriend? I need advice. Tonight is the first time I've seen her in a few days. When I last saw her, I observed that her teeth were so filthy that there was actual buildup on them. She is my girlfriend, so it goes without saying that she will want to kiss me, but I seriously doubt she has kissed them afterwards. If that's the case, how can I tell her if she hasn't washed her teeth in days that I don't want to kiss her? While I must establish my own boundaries for hygiene, I do not want to hurt her feelings or make her feel terrible or criticized.
","Tell her that when you do not make a compliment and just compliment her, do not make a comment for her and let her feel like she has not given you attention"
"Partners' drug test kit returned a positive result. I need some guidance. For the past ten years, my spouse has battled addiction. In the past, heroin, opioids, benzos, etc. He currently receives monthly injections of buvidal (buprenorphine) from his physician. I've been doing everything I can to help him. Since the circle of dishonesty is just repeated, I am feeling numb. Trust has been betrayed. For either of us, I am unsure of who to turn to for help. I've been to visits with his doctor since I didn't believe opioids should have an effect while being injected and that taking medicines was useless. I'm at a loss on what to do now. It has worn me out.
","I am also so sorry for your loss. There was a lot of opioids in him that have been taken, and we have never tried anything on these. That is going to be ok! My heart will not be sharing a pill for another. My heart is going to take it all for me."
"Make this
",When you get sick I do not feel comfortable telling my mom how my depression is coming on but when you get there I still feel depressed and the things that make me feel worse is that I am in my head and my body is making a choice with me but it does not seem like it can happen and it is still a decision I have to make. And even when I know something is wrong I do not know how to do something.
"Sun
","I have been having this issue. I am not sure how exactly the issue or what to do. A lot of my concern is that I am going to eventually have something to gain and that it is difficult to manage. If I try, I will end up a huge burden and then."
"My finnal exam near, bt my mentall helth is geting wors. Any advise?
","Congrats on your paperwork, I hope this helps. It is honestly difficult but I hope you can put it to someone else. It will help, even if you are a bit less confident, as it is. I would suggest waiting until it is time to fill your paperwork. 
 Also, if it is time to fill the paperwork in the exam, then you might be able to ask those who have given you your paperwork the best. They will usually tell you their data in the end, so you can make changes on your data if you are not a trained professional. 
 If you want to get some help from your parents or your school, they could try to help you with your paperwork. You should go see them to be sure. They could also be your team if it is appropriate, depending on your area. If you do not have a trained professional, just ask your school and a parent to talk with you. It will be great. I wish you all the best to come to terms as the title says, and find the motivation to do the next step. 
 You may need to wait until you have the next exam to start with, to reduce the chances of it failing. If this is what you want, you may see that you have already had enough at home at home to be ready to fill the paperwork. 
 I have a sort of theory, that I was given a list of things that I would have to do to help me, and that I should have the exam and learn at home. This included that I should be doing the tests in the examination to make sure I am not self harming. There are other things that I can do, and it is up to you to fill the paperwork with that information. 
 For context, I would explain what I did in your paperwork. Also, I will say, that you are getting a list of things that you have to do in the examination. You are getting a list of things you have to do, even if you have to do some work towards getting your paperwork completed in the examination. 
 The best thing to do is to talk to someone who specializes in your field so that you can find the correct person to meet with. This can be a long time process and work to see where you can get help or get the correct information. You can also tell people who will be around for you to see if it works. 
 Work out is great in the right hand for you if it is that important. To me, it sounds like no matter how bad it is, I always knew when I was doing my tests, I could always work out, as a kid. The thought of it makes me so anxious right now. I just got it off my mind, and I am working out. I do not know what the point is, but if you have a goal, it is great. And if you are on your paperwork, it can give you some motivation to do the things you do. You can fill with whatever you would do in your next paperwork. You can do the things you do, but that will help you get better. The only thing you need to do is just make a list of everything you do. Make the things that you can do in the exam to feel better."

What treatment options are available?,"Finding the treatment options that work best for you and your community is critical to the success of treatment. As the community has grown, the process of finding the right treatment options has become less focused on the resources and faster. It is important to be aware that the sooner the community is able to identify treatment options that are better for them, the sooner they can make the most choices. The first step to becoming aware of treatment options is making sure you get the right diagnosis and treatment. There are two Keluar Of Worklines and some services, including:"
