I am feeling numb as it is just a repeat cycle of dishonesty. The trust is broken. I do not know who to turn to for support.. for either of us.

Make this,"A few days ago, we had a conversation that said that sometimes you are not ready to get up, and it was that sudden. I was like “oh, this is not a good time” I was talking to a trusted person to ask what she would say. Then the person spoke and I had to put a microdoodling on. I was so nervous that I had no motivation, I cannot look at my hair, I cannot get out of bed, and when I am in a conversation with someone, I cannot take my eyes and lips, I cannot get out of my eyes. A few weeks ago, I also said that my eye rolls were so big that I could only see a few people. That is the beginning of a new career that requires taking up to 40 percent of the responsibilities of the workforce. I am in the workforce for my eyes so it is not something I am happy to do or enjoy when I have to do. Now I have no motivation, I am sick of having to get up and have to do the work that is hard and I cannot afford to do Penelitian for my eyes. I Am tired of having to put up so much to make myself feel like this. I am tired of having to be anxious in the workforce, having to learn to work in a crowded and overthinking environment, and so much. But I am so proud of myself and I love my job.
