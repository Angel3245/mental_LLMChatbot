Who does mental illness affect?,"I am an addict who has been through many different types of addiction for years now.  My first experience was heroin (I have never smoked) but then came back into this after being sober about 3 months ago when my friends started talking me up as someone that could help them out or something like that: ""So you are going on drugs?"" ""I do! You can get away from all your problems if only one thing keeps coming along...your brain!!",0.19,0.1
What treatment options are available?,I am currently on an antidepressant medication called Lendylol (L-arginine) which works like any other drug but has side effects that can be severe if taken too long.  It takes about 3 months for your body’s metabolism of this substance orally start working again so you will need more than just taking one pill at once,0.12,0.14
Where can I go to find a support group?,You are right that there will be many groups out here but you should always check if they have any kind of help for your needs or just want some advice on how things might work better.  It may take time before someone else finds something helpful,0.19,0.23

"Is it fair to ask may partner if he can refrain from talking about calories? My partner is an endurance athlete and has been increasing his training intensity, frequency, etc. It is happened a handful of times now where, around meal time, he will reference how many calories he burned per his app or whatever he uses to program his workouts. For context, he references calories in this context like, “I am ready to eat because I am so unusually hungry, which makes sense because I apparently burned x calories during my workout”. He is aware of my ED history and has been supportive so far. I want to ask him not to talk about calories in front of me because it is honestly triggering. That said, I do not know how to approach this conversation or if it is even fair of me to make this request. TIA for any advice or support.",Yes you are right that we should be open minded when discussing food choices.  We all have our own preferences but there’s no reason why people can’t get along well without being honest on their feelings,0.16,0.08
"I need advice on how to approach my depressed girlfriend. I am seeing her tonight for the first time in a few days. Last time I saw her, I noticed her teeth were unclean, to the point there was physical build up on them. She is my girlfriend, so obviously she is going to want a kiss, but I highly doubt she is brushed them since then. If that is the case, what is the best way to tell her I do not want to kiss her if she has not brushed her teeth in weeks? I need to set my hygienic boundaries but I do not want to offend her or make her feel bad and judged.",You can always ask your girlfriends friends about their hygiene habits (or even just talk). They will be able help you out of this situation,0.21,0.14
"Partners drug test kit was positive. I am seeking advice. My partner of 10 years has always struggled with addiction. Heroin in the past, opioids and benzos etc. He is currently getting monthly buvidal (Buprenorphine) injections at his doctor.. I have been trying to support him as much as I can. We have been through a lot and I adore him. He is not a bad human, he is a hard working beautiful human that is struggling. Last night I took a drink from a water bottle in my car, that he had bought that day - it tasted like chemicals and I felt strange after. Upon asking him, he denyed anything (maybe It was in my head). I got an at home drug test kit this morning and tested the bottle/ water. It tested positive for opioids and methadone. I confronted him and he said he f'd up.. I do not know what to do.. it is the looking me in the eyes and lying.. I feel like such a fool. We are actively trying to conceive.. I am feeling numb as it is just a repeat cycle of dishonesty. The trust is broken. I do not know who to turn to for support.. for either of us. I have attended appointments with his doctor, I did not think opioids were supposed to have an affect when on the injections.. that taking drugs were pointless. I do not know what to do anymore.. I am exhausted by it.. and I am fully aware he is too.",You should be able get help if you want but there will still come time where your life becomes more difficult than ever,0.22,0.14

Which types of people are affected from a mental disorder?,"I am an addict who has been through many different things over my life.  My parents were divorced when i was 5 years old but they had no problem keeping me away because their kids would go out for hours at night playing games or watching TVs while we watched them (I have never seen that before). They did get into trouble once after our divorce so now there will be more problems as well since then.

Where should I look for a therapy group?,"You can find therapists online or at your local community center.  They are trained professionals who will help you identify what needs treatment (eating disorder) and/or how that might be addressed through their own experience of dealing specifically on this issue.

Describe mental health.,"I am an addict who has been for over 10 years now but have never really had any problems before.  My problem started when my parents divorced me because of alcohol abuse (I was 12) so they gave up on their kids after that as well which made them feel like nothing happened between us anymore until one day i got drunk at school while doing homework . It took about 3 months from then till today where all this stuff came back into play again ,and since its just drinking we are still together even though our relationship seems broken right away

"Is it appropriate to request that my partner refrain from bringing up calories? My partner has been upping the volume, frequency, and other aspects of his training. He has mentioned how many calories he expended according to his app or whatever he uses to schedule his workouts a few times recently, usually around mealtime. He is aware of my past with eating disorders and has so far shown support. Since talking about calories in front of me is actually triggering, I want to ask him to refrain. Having said that, I'm not sure how to start this conversation or even if my request is reasonable. TIA for any assistance or counsel.",Yes you can do anything at all but please be careful what kind words are used,0.38,0.11
"How should I approach my depressed girlfriend? I need advice. Tonight is the first time I've seen her in a few days. When I last saw her, I observed that her teeth were so filthy that there was actual buildup on them. She is my girlfriend, so it goes without saying that she will want to kiss me, but I seriously doubt she has kissed them afterwards. If that's the case, how can I tell her if she hasn't washed her teeth in days that I don't want to kiss her? While I must establish my own boundaries for hygiene, I do not want to hurt her feelings or make her feel terrible or criticized.",You are right about cleaning your mouth after eating.

"Partners' drug test kit returned a positive result. I need some guidance. For the past ten years, my spouse has battled addiction. In the past, heroin, opioids, benzos, etc. He currently receives monthly injections of buvidal (buprenorphine) from his physician. I've been doing everything I can to help him. Since the circle of dishonesty is just repeated, I am feeling numb. Trust has been betrayed. For either of us, I am unsure of who to turn to for help. I've been to visits with his doctor since I didn't believe opioids should have an effect while being injected and that taking medicines was useless. I'm at a loss on what to do now. It has worn me out.",You are right about this guy's problem getting worse every month or so.  They will never get better because they don't want you anymore,0.24,0.13
