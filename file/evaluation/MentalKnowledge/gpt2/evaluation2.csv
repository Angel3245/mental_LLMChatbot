"My final exam is near, but my mental health is getting worse. Any advice?
","My therapist is really incompetent, but i do not think they care what she says. I can only hope she is going to get better."
"Who does mental illness affect?
","Many of us have similar problems that affect our mental health, so I would like to ask one of your friends to talk about mental illness, maybe you guysâ€™ answers could be inspirational."
"What treatment options are available?
","Psychotherapy has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms, but there are several medications and therapies that can help."
"Where can I go to find a support group?
","There are many groups out there for anyone who struggles with addiction. Some are simple and others can get in and out of a lot of trouble. In the groups, there is the opportunity for you to reach out to an experienced and kind person and help build the group you want to hold in. There are lots of online groups where you can get advice on things like addiction treatment and support from friends and family members. There are lots of websites and websites that offer helpful resources as well, as well as many groups that offer resources for those who are struggling with substance abuse. There is a number of support groups out there to help you and your loved ones deal with the effects of addiction and recovery. If you have difficulty finding a support group, oxygen is your friend's best resource. There are a number of online groups that offer resources for those struggling with substance abuse and it is helpful to find that group if you have questions or concerns about being there. The best resource you can find will be your local county's Substance Abuse & Recovery. As a reminder: I know there are some people who are going through an opioid withdrawal episode, but I am not talking about the addiction, nor do I want to hurt them. You also need to talk to someone who is experiencing the symptoms of the episode, who has experienced withdrawal and will be able to talk them through it. Even if you are not doing that, there are a lot of people who are doing the same things. Talk to them to find out how they can help you, and be open to talking about what you need to do to help them. If you are struggling with a lot of stuff, talk to someone like someone who is bipolar or someone with an eating disorder and they can find a support group to help you. Also, talk to your family, especially a loved one who is experiencing these issues and will be able to give you an understanding of what your loved one is feeling about this episode and what help you need. Be aware that there is a lot of stuff that may be helpful, but it might not always be enough to get through to them. Some things that may be helpful include getting some advice on ways to break free of withdrawal symptoms or recovery, getting an assessment of your mental health, and learning how to get help with alcohol and substance use disorders."

"What should I do if I am worried about a friend or relative?
","It is extremely important to know your friend and potential relative. That is why I encourage you to seek professional help if you are concerned about a friend or relative. If you are worried about someone, talk to them first and determine whether the concern is genuine or a misunderstanding. You will want to talk to an experienced professional about the situation."
"Is it fair to ask may partner if he can refrain from talking about calories? My partner is an endurance athlete and has been increasing his training intensity, frequency, etc. It is happened a handful of times now where, around meal time, he will reference how many calories he burned per his app or whatever he uses to program his workouts. For context, he references calories in this context like, \u201cI am ready to eat because I am so unusually hungry, which makes sense because I apparently burned x calories during my workout\u201d. He is aware of my ED history and has been supportive so far. I want to ask him not to talk about calories in front of me because it is honestly triggering. That said, I do not know how to approach this conversation or if it is even fair of me to make this request. TIA for any advice or support.
","Absolutely, but if you are aware you should approach it in a reasonable way, just because he is uncomfortable talking about calories in front of you. You may want to talk about that in a healthy way. We all know that he uses his app to program his workouts for a few hours at a time, and he probably would like to be able to see how many calories that you consume per day. That is something he can adjust to as needed. It is something he has been taking steps to avoid, however, for his personal use."
"I need advice on how to approach my depressed girlfriend. I am seeing her tonight for the first time in a few days. Last time I saw her, I noticed her teeth were unclean, to the point there was physical build up on them. She is my girlfriend, so obviously she is going to want a kiss, but I highly doubt she is brushed them since then. If that is the case, what is the best way to tell her I do not want to kiss her if she has not brushed her teeth in weeks? I need to set my hygienic boundaries but I do not want to offend her or make her feel bad and judged.
","Hey, the way things are going at this point right now is your partner's response and behavior. She has never brushed her teeth, but she washes them down for weeks because she wants to feel good about herself. You are telling her that you have not brushed her teeth at all right now, but if she does that will she feelviolent if she sees you. You do not want her to feel like she is a bitch or something. Do not be mad. She wants you to know that you are not going to have a hard time being her mommy and just want a hug or a kiss. I do not know how much you have read here, but I am not going to pretend that I am understanding her, you do not need to be angry or hurt. I know this sounds like you think it is just me, but I do not have to be angry or hurt to her. What I am going to be asking is advice on how to approach this situation. Do not just say I do not want to kiss her, but that she has brushed them down for weeks and wants to feel good about herself. Do not say you just want a kiss. This is not an open door. When you say this, try to be gentle with her so she understands you. It is a personal matter. Do not try to push her into having a ""good day"" or ""good day"" or whatever. She will get to keep brushing the teeth and will be okay. Do not let her kiss you because it is not your style. She does not want a kiss but you are trying to be subtle. Be gentle, be supportive, and just listen. She may not feel like you care and just want a hug or a kiss, but I am trying to be supportive with her. This is a personal matter, and the right thing to do."
"Partners drug test kit was positive. I am seeking advice. My partner of 10 years has always struggled with addiction. Heroin in the past, opioids and benzos etc. He is currently getting monthly buvidal (Buprenorphine) injections at his doctor.. I have been trying to support him as much as I can. We have been through a lot and I adore him. He is not a bad human, he is a hard working beautiful human that is struggling. Last night I took a drink from a water bottle in my car, that he had bought that day - it tasted like chemicals and I felt strange after. Upon asking him, he denyed anything (maybe It was in my head). I got an at home drug test kit this morning and tested the bottle/ water. It tested positive for opioids and methadone. I confronted him and he said he f'd up.. I do not know what to do.. it is the looking me in the eyes and lying.. I feel like such a fool. We are actively trying to conceive.. I am feeling numb as it is just a repeat cycle of dishonesty. The trust is broken. I do not know who to turn to for support.. for either of us. I have attended appointments with his doctor, I did not think opioids were supposed to have an affect when on the injections.. that taking drugs were pointless. I do not know what to do anymore.. I am exhausted by it.. and I am fully aware he is too.
","If you are having trouble please speak to your partner about these things.. they may not be for everyone, just because they happen. As you may or may not be able to talk to your partner, if you feel comfortable talking about your own problems, you may have a chance of going forward and working towards a future relationship."
"I have a final exam soon but I have mental health problems. What should I do?
","I need to get in touch with my family and friends. I am currently in therapy and want to be prepared for an exam by the end of next week. The more tests you go to, the less time you waste. I do not know what I am going to do right now and I want to be prepared. This sounds like a crazy idea but you should get in touch to the nearest exam provider because you will be able to talk about your mental health. You can also talk to your teachers about your mental health. If you feel that there is anything you need to know about your mental health, I would really appreciate your input. My therapist is already there, they are going to be helpful."
"Which types of people are affected from a mental disorder?
",People who are struggling with an eating disorder like depression or bipolar disorder
"Which treatments could I receive?
","This is a huge question for me. I had some very serious illness in late October and as such, I had a family physician that helped me get my body checked out and it took about an hour. My doctors do not want to prescribe drugs at all, so I would need to go see a psychiatrist, who will likely have more details about me."
"Where should I look for a therapy group?
","Some people will say that therapy can help. In some cases you should seek a professional in order to get the most out of your life. Other times you should seek a treatment program that has been productions with members of your family or friends. Treatment programs and peer support are helpful. Some therapists recommend a number of programs including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Counseling Skills with Disability, Skills with Dependency, and Therapy of Self-Reliance. The best program will offer you the most support and motivation in the least amount of time possible. Your personal issues and problems can be resolved with a trained professional."
"Describe mental health.
","I am a 21 year old college student. My diagnosis was MTF with a delusional psychotic episode of schizophrenia. After the psychosis, I spent the rest of my life in abusive relationships, then on a therapist, then on a psychiatrist and finally on my therapist's family. I am currently recovering but I am so afraid to talk about it because I feel ashamed I am hurting my family and I know I will not be able to live in peace if I am ever in harm's way. It is so hard to be honest with myself about what I am feeling, I feel really hopeless and even afraid to tell my therapist because I feel like she is the one telling me what to do and that I have no way out. So I am trying to get advice from a mental health professional if I am ever in harm's way. The only advice I can give is to do whatever it takes and be careful with how you tell my therapist. My dad died suddenly, I was a little older than him, so I do not want to be a burden to my family and my friends. I did not get help for that and I feel really unfulfilled. But I know it is very hard to tell my therapist what to do, and I am hoping someone will help. It is a very personal experience, I feel like I should not be asking for help because I am just too scared to tell anyone I am hurting because I know it will hurt and it will hurt me. I feel so horrible. Is there anything I can do that can make me feel better? I am looking into other mental health resources. My friends are very supportive, and I really do not know what else will work."
"What could I do if a friend or family member has my concern?
","You could write them a letter or just call them on it, but you can probably just ask them for their phone number, and if they need it, then you could just get a text message, and they could call your mom and dad and say they care about you. I know it sounds dumb, but I do not know how you would feel if someone texted them the wrong information, that would mean you were asking for their phone number. If you want to call them on their situation, then you could text them a letter asking for their permission to reach out. I understand they can get it if they want to. I just want them to know you are here for them, and if they think you are worried, then get your phone number to get them through their hotline and talk with them. If they do not want their calls, you could just call them and ask for their permission to reach out. That way, they are here for you, they are just here to talk to you and they will understand. If they think you are not there for them right now, then just talk. If they do not like you, they will say they are fine with you and they will get to a place they can talk about it to you. I recommend that you do not have them sign anything, even if you are not there for them. I recommend they do not ask or say anything too much or that they will not speak to you in certain situations, but just say you are there to talk to and that you appreciate them. I just want them to know that you are here for them, and if they are upset that they are not getting along, that you appreciate them, then you can talk to them. I personally do not think it is the right thing to do, but if you do not get along, then you can just call their hotline and call them and see if they would like you to speak to them. If they do not like you, you can just talk. I promise you, you will get through this if they ask for it. I know they are not going to be upset, but you can just get a text message, or whatever you can do. I know your parents may not want you to be here for them, but I do not think they would mind giving you a hug. I know your parents have some family problems, and I know you just need to do a good thing, so they can get through this. I know they do not feel like this is the right thing to do. I know you are getting through this, and they have been there for you, but if you do not want them to, then just call them. I am sorry for any disappointment they may have caused you, and I know they will not want you to try to do anything too much, or else it may just go to waste. I know I will try, but I know you are in this for the best, and I do not want it to take away the promise you made for them. I know it is difficult, and that it is up to you to do the right thing. But the more that you let them have it, the better off they'll be, and the more that you love them, and the more that you love them, and the more that you support them, I know this is not the right thing to do, and I know it is better to do what you can, but I am asking you to do something for the people that are doing this to help you. I have reached out to you, and I am asking that you take a deep breath, and do it in the moment and take a few moments to yourself to think about these things, and do whatever you can to do right now, because I know that is what is best for them. I know that there is a way to make this easier, and that it will not work, but you know this, and I know you are doing it right now, and I know that you will get through this. I know you are not going to feel like this is the way it is, and I know you do not want to be doing this. I know there are other things you can do, and I know there are other people that will listen, and you know that it is good to listen. But you just need to do it in the moment. You are doing this for the love of them, and I know that. If you do not want them to, then just go. I promise, you will get through this. I hope you feel the same way. I know there is no other choice, just do it in the moment, and do whatever you can do to be there for them. I know there is a way to make this easier, and I know you will get through this"
"Is it appropriate to request that my partner refrain from bringing up calories? My partner has been upping the volume, frequency, and other aspects of his training. He has mentioned how many calories he expended according to his app or whatever he uses to schedule his workouts a few times recently, usually around mealtime. He is aware of my past with eating disorders and has so far shown support. Since talking about calories in front of me is actually triggering, I want to ask him to refrain. Having said that, I'm not sure how to start this conversation or even if my request is reasonable. TIA for any assistance or counsel.
","Yes, I am a healthy person and I can feel very happy with what I do. I can eat as well as I want and still maintain my regular levels of motivation. I still feel incredibly guilty about it because I cannot believe it is possible to go around having people do that and having my partner do that makes the only thing worse. He does not know how to do better than that. I am in therapy and doing a lot of work on it. However, I still want to feel happy. And I want to feel better and get better. He told me he is happy and he knows he is hurting. I just do not know how to respond."
"How should I approach my depressed girlfriend? I need advice. Tonight is the first time I've seen her in a few days. When I last saw her, I observed that her teeth were so filthy that there was actual buildup on them. She is my girlfriend, so it goes without saying that she will want to kiss me, but I seriously doubt she has kissed them afterwards. If that's the case, how can I tell her if she hasn't washed her teeth in days that I don't want to kiss her? While I must establish my own boundaries for hygiene, I do not want to hurt her feelings or make her feel terrible or criticized.
","She has a very normal way of doing things. So the best advice she has is to go to your dentist for one. Do not worry, she probably does not understand this, so she will be fine. You can tell her you want to kiss her."
"Partners' drug test kit returned a positive result. I need some guidance. For the past ten years, my spouse has battled addiction. In the past, heroin, opioids, benzos, etc. He currently receives monthly injections of buvidal (buprenorphine) from his physician. I've been doing everything I can to help him. Since the circle of dishonesty is just repeated, I am feeling numb. Trust has been betrayed. For either of us, I am unsure of who to turn to for help. I've been to visits with his doctor since I didn't believe opioids should have an effect while being injected and that taking medicines was useless. I'm at a loss on what to do now. It has worn me out.
","I know that they can get away with all the traumas. There is nothing like a withdrawal from opioids. I know that a doctor will take the appropriate dose, but it is just too bad they got too high for the substance, so that's why they took him. For his medical needs, you cannot take opioids and it has not helped for him."
"Make this
","Just making sure I am not making it. Just making sure. I will make sure that your girlfriend is on her own, but she is going to get a new apartment or you know she is going to make it and not be able to do whatever she needs for a while."
"Sun
","Hello. When I was younger, my mother told me I should not do any work at night. I never even thought of working out. So when I was 12, I made a deal with my teacher saying I would do nothing and then she said I should not do work at night. I was shocked because it was after the night that I broke it and my parents took pity on me and told me not to worry. Now when I am 15, I find myself at home worrying about how I will look. I do not have an appetite or feel heavy because my body cannot cope with my surroundings. I do not know what to do. I do not know how I can take care of myself and I know that my mind and heart will be in danger if I do not do this. I am looking forward to being a good worker. Also, I am pretty smart and had no motivation to do much. I used to like to be lazy, because I would look for work so I could spend the night alone and not really do anything to work. Now I am not lazy but I can just not stop thinking of other things, like writing. I have not worked out since high school. I did not get to work till my 15th grade. Now I am 15 but I am learning a lot, I feel like I have learnt a lot and I am learning that you have to do something at the same time. I do not really think I am good at anything because it is just too much time and it does not help that I have been struggling. How I will cope with it will not be easy, because I have struggled for a long time. I do not want to be a burden to others, and I have made mistakes in life that will be hard to fix, but at least I am going to do my best to do what I can. And I know I can, because I know I will have to do it. So I hope my advice can be helpful for you. Thank you all so much."
"My finnal exam near, bt my mentall helth is geting wors. Any advise?
","Have a few years on the boat before deciding that you cannot handle it. If you have already gone in to a bt, you can go the whole boat, even though you might get there later. If you have been on a bt, you do not need to take off. I did it because of my finnal exam at the end of my third year. I had been doing it too much. Now I have been on bt for a month, and it is almost two weeks in. I would not want to do it again if I am already suffering from depression, but I will be doing it now. If you are not in the boat, you may have a chance at finding a good bt if you go into it the right way. You do not need to go in or go anywhere you want to get started."
"Who do mental illnes afect?
","As mentioned, my partner, i have always been diagnosed with mental illness, anxiety, and depression. And now i am getting a diagnosis from the mental health agency. My parents are going to therapy for me and my mental health and I will have my own psychiatrist, my family therapist, and a mental health professional if necessary. i have no family, i am just a very young person. I am really worried about the negative repercussions of my mental illness and am just trying to see if any of my parents (and my grandparents) understand that I should not be getting help for my mental health. I would also recommend checking into a psychiatrist or a private specialist if you do not think that is a good fit."
What treatment options are available?,"I believe in treatment but what are some things you can and cannot do to help?
 OCD:
Getting better. Being in treatment. Be aware of what it takes to do it."
