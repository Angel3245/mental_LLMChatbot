Who does mental illness affect?,"I am a very depressed person and depressed as well, having a lot of bipolar and other thoughts and memories. I get this feeling that the only thing that is stopping me is the thought of it. My other hobbies include videogames and blogging, reading books and enjoying movies and music. I used to be pretty socially inept, and now I am pretty confident in my Dependability. Depression is probably not affecting me at all, but it does impact me in some way.",0.4,0.21

What is mental health?,"I think of it in terms of things like a disorder like depression, anxiety, and depression. When it comes to mental health, depression has a lot of side effects. My family were going through it, I think. The idea that someone else is going through the same thing, and that someone else is going through something similar. It just sounds like there are a lot of different mental health issues. When I was growing up, I used to think the same. I remember it was pretty extreme. I yard off the shit I hear that someone who did things to others was going through something similar. I felt like shit myself. The only real thing was just being able to live with it. I can remember the feeling of being out there and then going, ""No, I can see if I can do that again"". And then that happened. I went on a binge, drank like a ton of water. That felt horrible. I was in depression for years. Eventually I realized, I had to do something. But I just kept going. I think I would have liked to stay in a different place without going anywhere. I could have gone out with a buddy, but I was like ""I could not find that place."" Hearing the same shit over and over again, that I can see if I can do something. Then finding some kind of support from others. Then finding something that I want to do or do not want to do, or I could take care of myself. It sounds like that is how I got into depression, right? That I could look after myself. Thenministry someone I care about, and let them work on something if thirds of my life was wasted. Now that I am a kid, I am kind of depressed and resentful of people who would be caring for me. I am in a different environment at my age, but the other kids do not like being in that environment. I do not think I was always that way. There is so much that I want to achieve, and that I know I can do, but that is not how it works. There is so much going on. When you are a kid, it does feel like you are putting in work that is not supposed to be done. And that is going to be stressful for the rest of your life. So, when you are in your 20's or 30's, you get depressed and resentful. Things that you have accomplished. But you do not think the next decade will be so great. And that is a lot of work. And you are in a different environment. It is exhausting to put that on hold, but it is worth it.",0.02,0.03

"Is it fair to ask may partner if he can refrain from talking about calories? My partner is an endurance athlete and has been increasing his training intensity, frequency, etc. It is happened a handful of times now where, around meal time, he will reference how many calories he burned per his app or whatever he uses to program his workouts. For context, he references calories in this context like, “I am ready to eat because I am so unusually hungry, which makes sense because I apparently burned x calories during my workout”. He is aware of my ED history and has been supportive so far. I want to ask him not to talk about calories in front of me because it is honestly triggering. That said, I do not know how to approach this conversation or if it is even fair of me to make this request. TIA for any advice or support.","Yes, you would be welcome to go into a gym or something like that and ask for your gym membership and it will justyet. The fact that there is something that is common among endurance athletes suggests that they are not necessarily eating too much and you would be surprised how many calories you are actually eating at one time. I know it is not a question. However, in some people there is going to be some kind of benefit if they do not just stop talking about calories, they will actually be making a difference. Also, exercise is one of the best ways to be healthier, exercise does not always have to be just one exercise, and some people like the notion that exercise is not just another way of exercising.",0.3,0.27
"I need advice on how to approach my depressed girlfriend. I am seeing her tonight for the first time in a few days. Last time I saw her, I noticed her teeth were unclean, to the point there was physical build up on them. She is my girlfriend, so obviously she is going to want a kiss, but I highly doubt she is brushed them since then. If that is the case, what is the best way to tell her I do not want to kiss her if she has not brushed her teeth in weeks? I need to set my hygienic boundaries but I do not want to offend her or make her feel bad and judged.","The beauty of it is, you are not alone in wanting someone to kiss your lips and give you permission. It is not something that everyoneroduces, and they are not perfect. It takes time and effort to work through, it is what you do.",0.38,0.25
"Partners drug test kit was positive. I am seeking advice. My partner of 10 years has always struggled with addiction. Heroin in the past, opioids and benzos etc. He is currently getting monthly buvidal (Buprenorphine) injections at his doctor.. I have been trying to support him as much as I can. We have been through a lot and I adore him. He is not a bad human, he is a hard working beautiful human that is struggling. Last night I took a drink from a water bottle in my car, that he had bought that day - it tasted like chemicals and I felt strange after. Upon asking him, he denyed anything (maybe It was in my head). I got an at home drug test kit this morning and tested the bottle/ water. It tested positive for opioids and methadone. I confronted him and he said he f'd up.. I do not know what to do.. it is the looking me in the eyes and lying.. I feel like such a fool. We are actively trying to conceive.. I am feeling numb as it is just a repeat cycle of dishonesty. The trust is broken. I do not know who to turn to for support.. for either of us. I have attended appointments with his doctor, I did not think opioids were supposed to have an affect when on the injections.. that taking drugs were pointless. I do not know what to do anymore.. I am exhausted by it.. and I am fully aware he is too.","Hey guys. I am currently gettingonia in my arms and being sober in between appointments. My partner does not have anything on the side, even his buprenorphine and opiates. He may have been using benzos at his dealer, maybe to try and buy more money. I have talked to him about buying a bottle of water and a bottle of water, but he seems to think they are too expensive. I have done this before (I have taken a bottle of water to his house last night) and he also feels like these drugs are too cheap. I do not know what to do. I do not know what to do. I just wanted to know if anyone has advice, advice on where I can get help. If not, I appreciate it. If not, I appreciate you. I would really appreciate it",0.11,0.14
I have a final exam soon but I have mental health problems. What should I do?,"Try to have regular, supportive conversations with your psychiatrist.

I will be in touch with an addiction specialist that is trying to find the best place for you to take care of yourself. The best way to go about it is by learning the signs of an addiction before they decide they are going to help you. You can always go to a local rehab facility to learn more.

"Is it appropriate to request that my partner refrain from bringing up calories? My partner has been upping the volume, frequency, and other aspects of his training. He has mentioned how many calories he expended according to his app or whatever he uses to schedule his workouts a few times recently, usually around mealtime. He is aware of my past with eating disorders and has so far shown support. Since talking about calories in front of me is actually triggering, I want to ask him to refrain. Having said that, I'm not sure how to start this conversation or even if my request is reasonable. TIA for any assistance or counsel.","I do not know what to do with my partner. I love him, I love him so much. I also know how his appetite changes and my partners relationship is not always what I am used to and sometimes get really anxious. The point is, I am not a professional in the traditional sense and you have been asked to be a very gentle and considerate one. Your feelings are valid. I want to learn from your experiences in making sure you are understanding that there is a lot of advice out there, but I am also just wondering, is there an actual way to do that if we really had to? Does it really matter? Also, is it possible to encourage your partner to take it seriously?",0.39,0.37
"How should I approach my depressed girlfriend? I need advice. Tonight is the first time I've seen her in a few days. When I last saw her, I observed that her teeth were so filthy that there was actual buildup on them. She is my girlfriend, so it goes without saying that she will want to kiss me, but I seriously doubt she has kissed them afterwards. If that's the case, how can I tell her if she hasn't washed her teeth in days that I don't want to kiss her? While I must establish my own boundaries for hygiene, I do not want to hurt her feelings or make her feel terrible or criticized.","The only thing I am going to tell her is how nice she is, what she likes about herself, what she is capable of doing for you, etc. She is the one who will give you advice in return for the compliment and your own. For example, she probably wants to see a doctor and a Pepe mexican, but they do not allow her to get her private trainer for mexican. Her dentist got her to go to the hospital and she was just so disappointed when the doctor was there. As soon as she left, she was so angry and yelled at the doctor. She even told me about how she had got on the wrong side of the law with her parents. She also said that she feels very embarrassed because she thinks she is beautiful. She even went on to say she is the prettiest girl in the world. She even went on to say that she never drinks or smokes, does not get high or takes a bath, and dresses like she is beautiful. She is actually pretty much the same way she pretends to be.",0.19,0.25
"Partners' drug test kit returned a positive result. I need some guidance. For the past ten years, my spouse has battled addiction. In the past, heroin, opioids, benzos, etc. He currently receives monthly injections of buvidal (buprenorphine) from his physician. I've been doing everything I can to help him. Since the circle of dishonesty is just repeated, I am feeling numb. Trust has been betrayed. For either of us, I am unsure of who to turn to for help. I've been to visits with his doctor since I didn't believe opioids should have an effect while being injected and that taking medicines was useless. I'm at a loss on what to do now. It has worn me out.","There are really just two choices. One is to tell your partner that you need to get some opioids, which would be an understandable decision, if you feel they are harming you. The other is to seek treatment as soon as you are ready to seek them, if you do not feel comfortable giving a referral to the nearest doctor.",0.23,0.18
Make this,"I really do not know what to do this is a little late, because I have already done a couple of stuff to help me in this sense. I recently got out of bed and was about to go do homework when I heard this and my eyes lit up. It turned out that the first thing I need to do is make my way to my favorite music. I tried to read through all of the lyrics on the album, but I was not able to and my eyes burned so hard. I am grateful that I do not want to get into an endless loop or having a pointless conversation about something that is not worth it.",0.04,0.05
"My finnal exam near, bt my mentall helth is geting wors. Any advise?","Just do not do it with the first round of bs. You can tell it to keep on bs and then try to skip it if it is not the worst bs you have, but it is a little better than skipping it. It would definitely be better if you just stayed safe. You are also not the best as a therapist because there is always the possibility you will get stuck in a cycle, the worst bs will always end up happening sooner, the best advice would be to get out of there and stay alive. I know what you are experiencing right now and I hope you feel better.",0.58,0.3
