"My final exam is near, but my mental health is getting worse. Any advice?","I am sorry you are going through this. I have been there before. It is hard to study when your mind is racing. I would suggest taking a break from studying for a bit. Go outside or do something else that will take your mind off of school. When you come back to studying, try to focus on one thing at a time. Do not worry about all of the material at once. You can always go back and review later if you need to. Also, make sure you are eating well and sleeping enough. These things help keep our minds working properly. Good luck!",0.53,0.26

I have been going to a depression/anxiety support group for about 2 years now and it has helped me so much. It is nice to be able to talk to people who understand what you are going through.,0.18,0.18

"Is it fair to ask may partner if he can refrain from talking about calories? My partner is an endurance athlete and has been increasing his training intensity, frequency, etc. It is happened a handful of times now where, around meal time, he will reference how many calories he burned per his app or whatever he uses to program his workouts. For context, he references calories in this context like, “I am ready to eat because I am so unusually hungry, which makes sense because I apparently burned x calories during my workout”. He is aware of my ED history and has been supportive so far. I want to ask him not to talk about calories in front of me because it is honestly triggering. That said, I do not know how to approach this conversation or if it is even fair of me to make this request. TIA for any advice or support.","It is not unreasonable at all to ask your partner to refrain from talking about calories when you are eating. You have every right to ask this of him. I would say something along the lines of “Hey babe, I just wanted to let you know that when we are eating together, I would really appreciate it if you did not mention calories. I know you are trying to be supportive but it is actually triggering for me.” Then if he continues to bring up calories, you can remind him again. I think it is important to remember that you are not being unreasonable here. This is a very common thing for people who struggle with disordered eating to find triggering. I hope he understands and respects your wishes!",0.38,0.35
"I need advice on how to approach my depressed girlfriend. I am seeing her tonight for the first time in a few days. Last time I saw her, I noticed her teeth were unclean, to the point there was physical build up on them. She is my girlfriend, so obviously she is going to want a kiss, but I highly doubt she is brushed them since then. If that is the case, what is the best way to tell her I do not want to kiss her if she has not brushed her teeth in weeks? I need to set my hygienic boundaries but I do not want to offend her or make her feel bad and judged.","You can say something like ""I love you, but I cannot kiss you when your breath smells like that."" It is honest and direct without being mean.",0.31,0.18
"Partners drug test kit was positive. I am seeking advice. My partner of 10 years has always struggled with addiction. Heroin in the past, opioids and benzos etc. He is currently getting monthly buvidal (Buprenorphine) injections at his doctor.. I have been trying to support him as much as I can. We have been through a lot and I adore him. He is not a bad human, he is a hard working beautiful human that is struggling. Last night I took a drink from a water bottle in my car, that he had bought that day - it tasted like chemicals and I felt strange after. Upon asking him, he denyed anything (maybe It was in my head). I got an at home drug test kit this morning and tested the bottle/ water. It tested positive for opioids and methadone. I confronted him and he said he f'd up.. I do not know what to do.. it is the looking me in the eyes and lying.. I feel like such a fool. We are actively trying to conceive.. I am feeling numb as it is just a repeat cycle of dishonesty. The trust is broken. I do not know who to turn to for support.. for either of us. I have attended appointments with his doctor, I did not think opioids were supposed to have an affect when on the injections.. that taking drugs were pointless. I do not know what to do anymore.. I am exhausted by it.. and I am fully aware he is too.",I am so sorry you are going through this. I am not sure if you are still together but I hope you are able to get out of this relationship. You deserve better than someone who lies to you about something so serious. I would be very concerned about your safety and the safety of any children you may have. Please take care of yourself.,0.27,0.28

Which treatments could I receive?,I am sorry you are going through this. You can get help from your doctor or therapist for depression. They may prescribe medication if they think it would be helpful. There are also online resources like 7 cups of tea where you can talk to someone about what you are feeling. It might be helpful to talk to someone who has been there before.,0.2,0.21
Where should I look for a therapy group?,I am looking for a therapy group too! I have been searching online but there are so many options and I do not know which one would be the most helpful. I am looking for something that will help me learn how to cope with my anxiety and depression. I am hoping to find a group that meets weekly or biweekly. Any suggestions?,0.19,0.22

"Is it appropriate to request that my partner refrain from bringing up calories? My partner has been upping the volume, frequency, and other aspects of his training. He has mentioned how many calories he expended according to his app or whatever he uses to schedule his workouts a few times recently, usually around mealtime. He is aware of my past with eating disorders and has so far shown support. Since talking about calories in front of me is actually triggering, I want to ask him to refrain. Having said that, I'm not sure how to start this conversation or even if my request is reasonable. TIA for any assistance or counsel.","I would say something like ""Hey babe, I really appreciate your support and understanding when it comes to my ED history. I just wanted to let you know that talking about calories is super triggering for me, so please don't do it around me."" It's important to be honest but also kind. You can also mention that you are happy to talk about nutrition with him, but not calories.",0.45,0.29
"How should I approach my depressed girlfriend? I need advice. Tonight is the first time I've seen her in a few days. When I last saw her, I observed that her teeth were so filthy that there was actual buildup on them. She is my girlfriend, so it goes without saying that she will want to kiss me, but I seriously doubt she has kissed them afterwards. If that's the case, how can I tell her if she hasn't washed her teeth in days that I don't want to kiss her? While I must establish my own boundaries for hygiene, I do not want to hurt her feelings or make her feel terrible or criticized.","I would just say something like ""hey babe, you have some food stuck between your teeth"" and then go about your business. It is not your job to clean up after her. You are not responsible for her hygiene.",0.27,0.18
"Partners' drug test kit returned a positive result. I need some guidance. For the past ten years, my spouse has battled addiction. In the past, heroin, opioids, benzos, etc. He currently receives monthly injections of buvidal (buprenorphine) from his physician. I've been doing everything I can to help him. Since the circle of dishonesty is just repeated, I am feeling numb. Trust has been betrayed. For either of us, I am unsure of who to turn to for help. I've been to visits with his doctor since I didn't believe opioids should have an effect while being injected and that taking medicines was useless. I'm at a loss on what to do now. It has worn me out.",I am so sorry you are going through this. My husband is an alcoholic and we have been together 10 years. We have two children. I have been trying to get him into rehab but he refuses. I am at my wits end. I don’t know how much longer I can take this. I feel like I am losing myself. I hope things work out for you.,0.23,0.24

How can I improve my studying skills?,"I am not sure if this will help but I have found that when I study for tests or quizzes I do better if I take notes on the material instead of just reading over it. I find that taking notes helps me remember things better than just reading them. Also, I try to make flashcards for myself so that I can review the information more easily. Hope this helps!",0.08,0.1
