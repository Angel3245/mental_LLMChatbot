"Is it fair to ask may partner if he can refrain from talking about calories? My partner is an endurance athlete and has been increasing his training intensity, frequency, etc. It is happened a handful of times now where, around meal time, he will reference how many calories he burned per his app or whatever he uses to program his workouts. For context, he references calories in this context like, “I am ready to eat because I am so unusually hungry, which makes sense because I apparently burned x calories during my workout”. He is aware of my ED history and has been supportive so far. I want to ask him not to talk about calories in front of me because it is honestly triggering. That said, I do not know how to approach this conversation or if it is even fair of me to make this request. TIA for any advice or support.","It is not fair to ask your partner to change their behavior just because you are uncomfortable with it. If you have a problem with something they say or do, then you need to address it directly with them. You cannot expect someone else to change their behavior just because it triggers you. That is unfair to them. If you feel comfortable enough to bring up the topic with them, then go ahead and do so. But do not expect them to change their behavior just because you are triggered by it.

"I need advice on how to approach my depressed girlfriend. I am seeing her tonight for the first time in a few days. Last time I saw her, I noticed her teeth were unclean, to the point there was physical build up on them. She is my girlfriend, so obviously she is going to want a kiss, but I highly doubt she is brushed them since then. If that is the case, what is the best way to tell her I do not want to kiss her if she has not brushed her teeth in weeks? I need to set my hygienic boundaries but I do not want to offend her or make her feel bad and judged.","You can say something like “I love you, but I cannot kiss you right now because your breath smells really bad.” Then offer to help her brush her teeth. You are not being mean by saying this, you are just setting a boundary. It is okay to have standards when it comes to personal hygiene. If she gets upset about it, then maybe she needs to work on her self-esteem. - Dr. Katherine M. Hertlein, clinical psychologist and certified sex therapist (Source)",0.27,0.23
"Partners drug test kit was positive. I am seeking advice. My partner of 10 years has always struggled with addiction. Heroin in the past, opioids and benzos etc. He is currently getting monthly buvidal (Buprenorphine) injections at his doctor.. I have been trying to support him as much as I can. We have been through a lot and I adore him. He is not a bad human, he is a hard working beautiful human that is struggling. Last night I took a drink from a water bottle in my car, that he had bought that day - it tasted like chemicals and I felt strange after. Upon asking him, he denyed anything (maybe It was in my head). I got an at home drug test kit this morning and tested the bottle/ water. It tested positive for opioids and methadone. I confronted him and he said he f'd up.. I do not know what to do.. it is the looking me in the eyes and lying.. I feel like such a fool. We are actively trying to conceive.. I am feeling numb as it is just a repeat cycle of dishonesty. The trust is broken. I do not know who to turn to for support.. for either of us. I have attended appointments with his doctor, I did not think opioids were supposed to have an affect when on the injections.. that taking drugs were pointless. I do not know what to do anymore.. I am exhausted by it.. and I am fully aware he is too.",I am so sorry you are going through this. I am also sorry your partner is going through this. I am not sure if you are still together or not but I would suggest you both seek help. You need to be able to talk about this openly without fear of judgement.

"How should I approach my depressed girlfriend? I need advice. Tonight is the first time I've seen her in a few days. When I last saw her, I observed that her teeth were so filthy that there was actual buildup on them. She is my girlfriend, so it goes without saying that she will want to kiss me, but I seriously doubt she has kissed them afterwards. If that's the case, how can I tell her if she hasn't washed her teeth in days that I don't want to kiss her? While I must establish my own boundaries for hygiene, I do not want to hurt her feelings or make her feel terrible or criticized.","I would just say something like ""hey babe, you look beautiful tonight"" and then go in for a kiss. If she pulls away, you could say ""oh sorry, I forgot about your teeth"". Then you can ask her if she wants to brush her teeth before you kiss again.
