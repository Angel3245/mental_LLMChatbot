"Is it fair to ask may partner if he can refrain from talking about calories? My partner is an endurance athlete and has been increasing his training intensity, frequency, etc. It is happened a handful of times now where, around meal time, he will reference how many calories he burned per his app or whatever he uses to program his workouts. For context, he references calories in this context like, “I am ready to eat because I am so unusually hungry, which makes sense because I apparently burned x calories during my workout”. He is aware of my ED history and has been supportive so far. I want to ask him not to talk about calories in front of me because it is honestly triggering. That said, I do not know how to approach this conversation or if it is even fair of me to make this request. TIA for any advice or support.",I have had similar conversations on social media (Facebook) but they are more focused than you might think,0.15,0.05
"I need advice on how to approach my depressed girlfriend. I am seeing her tonight for the first time in a few days. Last time I saw her, I noticed her teeth were unclean, to the point there was physical build up on them. She is my girlfriend, so obviously she is going to want a kiss, but I highly doubt she is brushed them since then. If that is the case, what is the best way to tell her I do not want to kiss her if she has not brushed her teeth in weeks? I need to set my hygienic boundaries but I do not want to offend her or make her feel bad and judged.","If you are really worried about your girl getting hurt (or worse), just let go of all expectations regarding their hygiene habits.",0.23,0.12
"Partners drug test kit was positive. I am seeking advice. My partner of 10 years has always struggled with addiction. Heroin in the past, opioids and benzos etc. He is currently getting monthly buvidal (Buprenorphine) injections at his doctor.. I have been trying to support him as much as I can. We have been through a lot and I adore him. He is not a bad human, he is a hard working beautiful human that is struggling. Last night I took a drink from a water bottle in my car, that he had bought that day - it tasted like chemicals and I felt strange after. Upon asking him, he denyed anything (maybe It was in my head). I got an at home drug test kit this morning and tested the bottle/ water. It tested positive for opioids and methadone. I confronted him and he said he f'd up.. I do not know what to do.. it is the looking me in the eyes and lying.. I feel like such a fool. We are actively trying to conceive.. I am feeling numb as it is just a repeat cycle of dishonesty. The trust is broken. I do not know who to turn to for support.. for either of us. I have attended appointments with his doctor, I did not think opioids were supposed to have an affect when on the injections.. that taking drugs were pointless. I do not know what to do anymore.. I am exhausted by it.. and I am fully aware he is too.",I would suggest you go see your GP or psychiatrist first if there seems some sort issue,0.18,0.09

"Is it appropriate to request that my partner refrain from bringing up calories? My partner has been upping the volume, frequency, and other aspects of his training. He has mentioned how many calories he expended according to his app or whatever he uses to schedule his workouts a few times recently, usually around mealtime. He is aware of my past with eating disorders and has so far shown support. Since talking about calories in front of me is actually triggering, I want to ask him to refrain. Having said that, I'm not sure how to start this conversation or even if my request is reasonable. TIA for any assistance or counsel.",I am just curious as well...,0.56,0.03
"How should I approach my depressed girlfriend? I need advice. Tonight is the first time I've seen her in a few days. When I last saw her, I observed that her teeth were so filthy that there was actual buildup on them. She is my girlfriend, so it goes without saying that she will want to kiss me, but I seriously doubt she has kissed them afterwards. If that's the case, how can I tell her if she hasn't washed her teeth in days that I don't want to kiss her? While I must establish my own boundaries for hygiene, I do not want to hurt her feelings or make her feel terrible or criticized.",I am sure you are going through this right now! It may be hard at times because of your anxiety about what people think (and even worse when they say something like “you have no idea”) But try doing things everyday instead just as much,0.12,0.15
"Partners' drug test kit returned a positive result. I need some guidance. For the past ten years, my spouse has battled addiction. In the past, heroin, opioids, benzos, etc. He currently receives monthly injections of buvidal (buprenorphine) from his physician. I've been doing everything I can to help him. Since the circle of dishonesty is just repeated, I am feeling numb. Trust has been betrayed. For either of us, I am unsure of who to turn to for help. I've been to visits with his doctor since I didn't believe opioids should have an effect while being injected and that taking medicines was useless. I'm at a loss on what to do now. It has worn me out.",I would suggest you go see your GP or psychiatrist first if possible,0.23,0.1
