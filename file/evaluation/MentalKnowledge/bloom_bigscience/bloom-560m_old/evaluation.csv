A person might experience mild-to-moderate levels only once per week; while another person's problem usually lasts several months. (3)  It doesn't matter where these issues come from:

(This may sound like too much information.) But it's important.  A lot depends upon your personality type--if you're outgoing/positive you'll need more info. (And don't forget there's always one person who's just going along side each other.)

What is mental health?,"How do you define your own term for this?

A:

(1) I think that there are two terms which can be used interchangeably.
First of all we have ""mental illness"" or ""maladie mentale"":
In general people who suffer from any kind (psychotic/anxiety disorder etc.) will experience some sort of: 

Anxiolysis - An individual feels anxious about things he doesn't like. 
Depression 
Distressing moods such as sadness, 
Stressful life events. 

So if someone has an anxiety problem he/she may feel depressed because they don't want anything bad happening but at least something good happens.  
Second one is: ""Mental Health problems""; i mean those issues where our brain can't process information correctly; so when somebody gets sick their body cannot function properly.  So what should happen?
If someone's suffering due to:  

A disease  
Unhealthy diet and/or lifestyle habits.  

They might get confused between these 2 concepts since both seem very similar except that:
(2)  Mental Illusion = A person thinks he's mentally ill. (I am talking here only regarding paranoia)
Mood Disorder   : This type usually occurs after having suffered traumatic experiences.

I have been thinking of going for an appointment at my doctor's office because I'm afraid that he will be very upset when we meet.
But now I've decided on this idea as well since it's easier than waiting until next week. 
So what are some things which could make him more concerned?
Expert(2)

A:

(a)
If your concern isn't just physical but psychological then there may still exist other reasons why you're anxious.  For example,
you might feel like someone else has taken over control - they don't want their own life anymore; they're trying so hard all day long...etc. (b)  You need reassurance from others who understand how important these feelings really are: 
You can't tell them what's wrong without asking yourself whether they've ever felt such fear before.
(c)   It doesn't matter where you've got anxiety – even though people around us often say ""it's normal""…but sometimes there's no one nearby who's able enough. 

In general terms,

It depends upon many factors including personality traits, (evaluations), age/sex/situation etc., lifestyle choices and/or social interactions.

"Is it fair to ask may partner if he can refrain from talking about calories? My partner is an endurance athlete and has been increasing his training intensity, frequency, etc. It is happened a handful of times now where, around meal time, he will reference how many calories he burned per his app or whatever he uses to program his workouts.

A:

You could try asking your friends/family members whether they've ever experienced such things yourself - it's usually easier doing something positive rather queing negative stuff.

""Is anyone else experiencing similar issues lately?  Are these problems affecting other people's lives too much?

You may find that they will be helpful if we give some advice on how this could work out. 

A:

I think it's important when talking at all (or even just chatting) whether you're actually asking yourself what kind/type questions might come up.  For example,
""How would an adult respond?"":
What type(s)  Do people usually get asked?
Is there any way you'd like me personally?  Is my personality really something I'm interested in:   Are these things relevant enough so I'd want more information from other adults? 
Are those answers useful and/or appropriate? 

In general though - don't try hard; instead focus only where possible.  
For example: 
""I am very happy because I've got lots...""; 

This isn't going anywhere unless there's no reason why one person can't say ""very happy"" without saying ""someone else's happiness too!""'

A:

In general terms - if someone feels like they're being judged or treated unfairly: 

If you're thinking negatively towards yourself then your thoughts will be negative; 
if you've got bad feelings around others you'll feel worse than before. 
  You may even get angry.  
You might think things aren't right on one level – such as: 
  ""I've just lost everything"" / ""I don't want anything anymore!"";  
Your body can react differently depending upon what kind/type/something's wrong.  

  So how should these reactions affect you:  

How would their reaction impact other people's lives?
What kinds and/or levels could those emotions cause? 
Do any changes occur within themselves?  Are certain aspects changed?
