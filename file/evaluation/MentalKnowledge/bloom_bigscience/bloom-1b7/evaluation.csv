"My final exam is near, but my mental health is getting worse. Any advice?",I am so sorry for your situation. I have been there too. My last year of college was really hard on me mentally as well. It took away from everything that made me happy about life. But now that I am done going through high school (and hopefully into university) things are starting to get better again. You need to take care of yourself right now. Take time out every day to do something you enjoy like reading or doing yoga. Make sure you eat healthy food and drink plenty of water. Also make sure you keep up with exercise because this will help improve your mood and overall well-being.,0.45,0.23

What treatment options are available?,"There are many different types of treatments for depression that can help you feel better about yourself and your life. 
 Some people choose medication as their first line of therapy because they think this will be the easiest way to get them through the day without feeling like they need to take any more pills than necessary. 
 Other people may want to try other forms of psychotherapy or counselling before taking medications. 
 There are some things that make each type of treatment unique so it’s important to talk to someone who knows what works well for you. 
 For example, if you’re struggling with anxiety symptoms but don’t have an underlying diagnosis of depression then talking to a therapist might work better for you. 
 You should always speak to your doctor first though when deciding on which form of treatment would suit you best. 
 It could even be worth speaking to both doctors and psychiatrists at once to see how all three approaches fit together. 
 Another thing to consider is whether there’s something else that’s working poorly for you. 
 Sometimes medicines just aren’t enough to bring back those feelings of happiness and well-being. 
 In these cases, another kind of treatment such as hypnotherapy or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) might be right up your alley.

What is mental health?,"Mental illness affects more than just your brain or emotions — it’s how you live your life. 
 Mental illness can be hard to diagnose because symptoms are often subtle and difficult to distinguish from normal mood swings. 
 Some people may have no idea they’re having an issue until their doctor tells them about it. 
 For example, if someone has depression but doesn’t show any signs of anxiety, that person might think they’re fine. 
 But when doctors look at their medical records, they find out that this person’s heart rate was too fast for his age; he had trouble sleeping due to insomnia; and he couldn’t remember what happened last night. 
 These things aren’t necessarily indicative of major problems like depression. 
 However, even minor issues such as these can make it harder for people to get help. 
 People who struggle with eating disorders (EDs) tend to experience severe distressing feelings while trying to control their weight. 
 They feel so ashamed of themselves that they can’t eat anything healthy. 
 Even though EDs don’t cause physical harm, many sufferers end up losing all hope of ever being able to lose weight again. 
 Many people with ADHD do not realize they need treatment until they start experiencing serious disruptions in their daily lives.",0.04,0.06
What should I do if I am worried about a friend or relative?,"If you are concerned for someone else’s well-being, consider calling them up and asking how they’re doing. 
 You can even text them an encouraging message saying “thank you” or “I love you”",0.12,0.11
"Is it fair to ask may partner if he can refrain from talking about calories? My partner is an endurance athlete and has been increasing his training intensity, frequency, etc. It is happened a handful of times now where, around meal time, he will reference how many calories he burned per his app or whatever he uses to program his workouts. For context, he references calories in this context like, “I am ready to eat because I am so unusually hungry, which makes sense because I apparently burned x calories during my workout”. He is aware of my ED history and has been supportive so far. I want to ask him not to talk about calories in front of me because it is honestly triggering. That said, I do not know how to approach this conversation or if it is even fair of me to make this request. TIA for any advice or support.",I think you should just say no. You are asking your partner to be honest but that person might feel uncomfortable saying yes.,0.36,0.13
"I need advice on how to approach my depressed girlfriend. I am seeing her tonight for the first time in a few days. Last time I saw her, I noticed her teeth were unclean, to the point there was physical build up on them. She is my girlfriend, so obviously she is going to want a kiss, but I highly doubt she is brushed them since then. If that is the case, what is the best way to tell her I do not want to kiss her if she has not brushed her teeth in weeks? I need to set my hygienic boundaries but I do not want to offend her or make her feel bad and judged.","You can say something like ""hey i have been cleaning your teeth""",0.07,0.05
"Partners drug test kit was positive. I am seeking advice. My partner of 10 years has always struggled with addiction. Heroin in the past, opioids and benzos etc. He is currently getting monthly buvidal (Buprenorphine) injections at his doctor.. I have been trying to support him as much as I can. We have been through a lot and I adore him. He is not a bad human, he is a hard working beautiful human that is struggling. Last night I took a drink from a water bottle in my car, that he had bought that day - it tasted like chemicals and I felt strange after. Upon asking him, he denyed anything (maybe It was in my head). I got an at home drug test kit this morning and tested the bottle/ water. It tested positive for opioids and methadone. I confronted him and he said he f'd up.. I do not know what to do.. it is the looking me in the eyes and lying.. I feel like such a fool. We are actively trying to conceive.. I am feeling numb as it is just a repeat cycle of dishonesty. The trust is broken. I do not know who to turn to for support.. for either of us. I have attended appointments with his doctor, I did not think opioids were supposed to have an affect when on the injections.. that taking drugs were pointless. I do not know what to do anymore.. I am exhausted by it.. and I am fully aware he is too.",I would say you should talk to your therapist about how they might be able to help you find someone else if you want to continue supporting them.,0.21,0.13

Describe mental health.,"I am currently on SSRI’s (fluoxetine) for depression and anxiety. I have been taking them for about 2 years now but they are causing me some serious side effects that make my life miserable. They cause severe dry mouth which makes eating difficult and causes nausea when I eat or drink anything. It has made me unable to sleep at night because of this issue. My hair gets very thin and brittle so much that I cannot even brush it anymore. This problem started after I stopped taking these drugs as soon as I could remember. When I was younger, I used to take them every day without any problems until I got older and developed more symptoms like those you describe. Nowadays, I do not use them nearly enough due to all the side effects I get from them.",0.06,0.08

"Is it appropriate to request that my partner refrain from bringing up calories? My partner has been upping the volume, frequency, and other aspects of his training. He has mentioned how many calories he expended according to his app or whatever he uses to schedule his workouts a few times recently, usually around mealtime. He is aware of my past with eating disorders and has so far shown support. Since talking about calories in front of me is actually triggering, I want to ask him to refrain.

"How should I approach my depressed girlfriend? I need advice. Tonight is the first time I've seen her in a few days. When I last saw her, I observed that her teeth were so filthy that there was actual buildup on them. She is my girlfriend, so it goes without saying that she will want to kiss me, but I seriously doubt she has kissed them afterwards. If that's the case, how can I tell her if she hasn't washed her teeth in days that I don't want to kiss her? While I must establish my own boundaries for hygiene, I do not want to hurt her feelings or make her feel terrible or criticized.","I think you are going about this wrong. You have no idea what your girlfriend wants from you. It may be something as simple as washing their mouths after eating (or whatever) or maybe they just like brushing their teeth every day. Whatever it is, try to get into their head and see where they would prefer to go when they wash their teeth.",0.18,0.14
"Partners' drug test kit returned a positive result. I need some guidance. For the past ten years, my spouse has battled addiction. In the past, heroin, opioids, benzos, etc. He currently receives monthly injections of buvidal (buprenorphine) from his physician. I've been doing everything I can to help him. Since the circle of dishonesty is just repeated, I am feeling numb. Trust has been betrayed. For either of us, I am unsure of who to turn to for help. I've been to visits with his doctor since I didn't believe opioids should have an effect while being injected and that taking medicines was useless. I'm at a loss on what to do now. It has worn me out.",I would suggest you go see your doctor first as they are experts in this area. They will be able to give you advice about how to proceed,0.24,0.15

How can I improve my studying skills?,"Studying skills are important for many reasons. They help you learn new things faster, they allow you to focus on what matters most — your studies — so that you can do them better, and they give you confidence when you need it most. But learning how to study well takes practice. You will have trouble mastering these skills if you just try hard enough without any guidance or accountability from others. Here’s some tips to get started.
1) Get organized. Start out by organizing all of your notes into folders (or even more conveniently, notebooks). This way, you’ll be able to see where each note belongs at a glance. Then start writing down everything that’s going on in your mind as soon as possible after reading something interesting. When you’re done, write down exactly what happened next, why it’s important, and anything else you think might come up while thinking about the topic. Once you’ve written this down, make sure you keep track of every time you read an article, watch a video, listen to podcasts, etc., because those kinds of activities often lead to ideas for future research questions.",0.03,0.04
