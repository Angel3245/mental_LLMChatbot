"My final exam is near, but my mental health is getting worse. Any advice?",I am so sorry for your situation. I have been there too. My friend had an anxiety attack last week that left her unable to do anything she wanted to do or even talk about things like this. She was able to get through most of it though because she knew what to say when needed. It took me forever to figure out how to help her after that one time.,0.58,0.21
Who does mental illness affect?,"Mental illness affects everyone differently. 
 Some people are more affected than others because of their genetics or other factors that make them vulnerable to developing an issue. 
 For example, some children have higher rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) due to genes that increase risk for ASD. 
 Other genetic conditions can cause problems like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which may be especially hard on kids who do not get enough sleep. 
 Children born prematurely — such as those born before 37 weeks gestation — often develop brain damage from birth that makes them at increased risk for learning disabilities later in life. 
 People with certain types of cancer, including leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin’s disease, multiple myeloma, and acute myeloid leukemia, may experience cognitive issues early in treatment. 
 Many people diagnosed with depression will need medication throughout their lives. 
 Those with schizophrenia may require medications during childhood and adolescence. 
 There are many different ways you might feel mentally ill. 
 You could find yourself feeling anxious about something, worried about someone, sad, angry, lonely, frustrated, depressed, hopeless, confused, or overwhelmed.

What treatment options are available?,"There are many different types of treatments for people who have an eating disorder. 
 Some of these include: 
  Individual therapy (also called cognitive-behavioral therapy) — This type of therapy focuses on changing your thoughts about food so that you can stop overeating or purging. It involves talking through how you think about food and what triggers you into overeating. You may be able to learn new ways of thinking about foods and start seeing them as pleasurable instead of unhealthy. For example, if you eat too much because you feel guilty when you see someone else eating more than you do, then you might want to try learning to say “thank you” rather than feeling bad at yourself afterward. Another way this kind of therapy works is by helping you understand why certain foods trigger you to overeat. By understanding this, you will be better equipped to avoid those foods altogether. In addition, individual therapy often includes other therapies like exercise, hypnosis, art therapy, music therapy, yoga, meditation, and relaxation techniques. These kinds of approaches help you develop skills needed to overcome your eating disorders without having to resort to medications. Other forms of therapy include group therapy, family therapy, and peer counseling. Group therapy allows",0.09,0.15

"Is it fair to ask may partner if he can refrain from talking about calories? My partner is an endurance athlete and has been increasing his training intensity, frequency, etc. It is happened a handful of times now where, around meal time, he will reference how many calories he burned per his app or whatever he uses to program his workouts. For context, he references calories in this context like, “I am ready to eat because I am so unusually hungry, which makes sense because I apparently burned x calories during my workout”. He is aware of my ED history and has been supportive so far. I want to ask him not to talk about calories in front of me because it is honestly triggering. That said, I do not know how to approach this conversation or if it is even fair of me to make this request. TIA for any advice or support.","I think you should be able to say no without being rude but that would probably mean saying something like: “you are doing too much exercise right now, maybe we could just go somewhere else instead”",0.21,0.11
"I need advice on how to approach my depressed girlfriend. I am seeing her tonight for the first time in a few days. Last time I saw her, I noticed her teeth were unclean, to the point there was physical build up on them. She is my girlfriend, so obviously she is going to want a kiss, but I highly doubt she is brushed them since then. If that is the case, what is the best way to tell her I do not want to kiss her if she has not brushed her teeth in weeks? I need to set my hygienic boundaries but I do not want to offend her or make her feel bad and judged.","You are right about setting your own rules.

"Partners drug test kit was positive. I am seeking advice. My partner of 10 years has always struggled with addiction. Heroin in the past, opioids and benzos etc. He is currently getting monthly buvidal (Buprenorphine) injections at his doctor.. I have been trying to support him as much as I can. We have been through a lot and I adore him. He is not a bad human, he is a hard working beautiful human that is struggling. Last night I took a drink from a water bottle in my car, that he had bought that day - it tasted like chemicals and I felt strange after. Upon asking him, he denyed anything (maybe It was in my head). I got an at home drug test kit this morning and tested the bottle/ water. It tested positive for opioids and methadone. I confronted him and he said he f'd up.. I do not know what to do.. it is the looking me in the eyes and lying.. I feel like such a fool. We are actively trying to conceive.. I am feeling numb as it is just a repeat cycle of dishonesty. The trust is broken. I do not know who to turn to for support.. for either of us. I have attended appointments with his doctor, I did not think opioids were supposed to have an affect when on the injections.. that taking drugs were pointless. I do not know what to do anymore.. I am exhausted by it.. and I am fully aware he is too.",I would say you need to talk to your therapist about how they see things. They may be able to help you find some other way forward.,0.21,0.1
