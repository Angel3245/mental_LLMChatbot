User: I am confused about this topic.
Bot:
1) How do you define mental illness?
2) Is there any difference between depression and anxiety? Do they have similar symptoms or are they different?
3) Are we able to diagnose these conditions using our own body language?
4) Can someone help me understand what causes stress?
5) Why would people become depressed if their environment was good for them?
6) Does anyone experience suicidal thoughts when stressed out?
7) When did social media start affecting us as well? 
8) Have you ever been diagnosed with an eating disorder?
9) What happens after your diagnosis of an eating disorder?
10) What can be done to prevent future episodes of panic attacks?

I think that most of the questions you've asked are valid.  But some may need more explanation than others.  
First off, it's important to note that ""mental illness"" has many definitions depending on who defines it (and how).  For example, one definition states that ""mental illness"" means ""a condition which affects the brain's ability to function normally"" while another definition states that ""mental illness"" means ""an inability to control one's emotions properly"".   So, even though you're asking about depression and anxiety, they're both defined differently.",0.04,0.09

"Is it fair to ask may partner if he can refrain from talking about calories? My partner is an endurance athlete and has been increasing his training intensity, frequency, etc. It is happened a handful of times now where, around meal time, he will reference how many calories he burned per his app or whatever he uses to program his workouts. For context, he references calories in this context like, “I am ready to eat because I am so unusually hungry, which makes sense because I apparently burned x calories during my workout”. He is aware of my ED history and has been supportive so far. I want to ask him not to talk about calories in front of me because it is honestly triggering. That said, I do not know how to approach this conversation or if it is even fair of me to make this request. TIA for any advice or support.",Hi there! We are here to help you out today.

"I need advice on how to approach my depressed girlfriend. I am seeing her tonight for the first time in a few days. Last time I saw her, I noticed her teeth were unclean, to the point there was physical build up on them. She is my girlfriend, so obviously she is going to want a kiss, but I highly doubt she is brushed them since then. If that is the case, what is the best way to tell her I do not want to kiss her if she has not brushed her teeth in weeks? I need to set my hygienic boundaries but I do not want to offend her or make her feel bad and judged.",You are right about this.

"Partners drug test kit was positive. I am seeking advice. My partner of 10 years has always struggled with addiction. Heroin in the past, opioids and benzos etc. He is currently getting monthly buvidal (Buprenorphine) injections at his doctor.. I have been trying to support him as much as I can. We have been through a lot and I adore him. He is not a bad human, he is a hard working beautiful human that is struggling. Last night I took a drink from a water bottle in my car, that he had bought that day - it tasted like chemicals and I felt strange after. Upon asking him, he denyed anything (maybe It was in my head). I got an at home drug test kit this morning and tested the bottle/ water. It tested positive for opioids and methadone. I confronted him and he said he f'd up.. I do not know what to do.. it is the looking me in the eyes and lying.. I feel like such a fool. We are actively trying to conceive.. I am feeling numb as it is just a repeat cycle of dishonesty. The trust is broken. I do not know who to turn to for support.. for either of us. I have attended appointments with his doctor, I did not think opioids were supposed to have an affect when on the injections.. that taking drugs were pointless. I do not know what to do anymore.. I am exhausted by it.. and I am fully aware he is too.","You need help.

He has mentioned how many calories he expended according to his app or whatever he uses to schedule his workouts a few times recently, usually around mealtime.

"How should I approach my depressed girlfriend? I need advice. Tonight is the first time I've seen her in a few days. When I last saw her, I observed that her teeth were so filthy that there was actual buildup on them. She is my girlfriend, so it goes without saying that she will want to kiss me, but I seriously doubt she has kissed them afterwards. If that's the case, how can I tell her if she hasn't washed her teeth in days that I don't want to kiss her? While I must establish my own boundaries for hygiene, I do not want to hurt her feelings or make her feel terrible or criticized.",You are right about this.

Since the circle of dishonesty is just repeated, I am feeling numb. Trust has been betrayed. For either of us, I am unsure of who to turn to for help.
