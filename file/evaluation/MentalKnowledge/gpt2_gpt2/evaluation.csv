My final exam is near, but my mental health is getting worse. Any advice?;My psychiatrist recommended an exam in early August. She said this is a long term affair, and they are not able to work anything out. If your anxiety gets the better of you after the exam (which is pretty common) then the exam is the best option. You might not have to get any tests, but if your anxiety goes down or if you find yourself doing poorly in school, you may want to get a second exam (which I have not found for a while). Some people might not get the second one, but they might end up doing good and finding success.;0.49;0.24;;;;;;;;;;;
Who does mental illness affect?;The average person has an illness and it affects so many different people, and I am sure that is just me. The most common illnesses are anxiety and depression. Other people also have anxiety and depression and have a lot of health problems. People with OCD have anxiety and it is pretty common. People with BPD tend to have problems with eating and other physical activity. People with psychosis have anxiety and its associated symptoms. People with schizophrenia have a lot of things that are called delusions and hallucinations, and it usually means that they see things, think they are real, and even think they are crazy. People with BPD are quite creative, creative and humanly in generating responses. Some people think they are mentally ill, and some people think they are just lying. They are not. They just have a lot of ideas about things, and sometimes it is just that their thoughts get stuck in thoughts they do not understand. Some people do not believe in God, because they do not believe that human beings are not just human, but that God is human. I am trying to understand people with these disorders, how they respond to what they do not understand. I have been in therapy for about 4 years and have a lot of amazing experiences with people with these disorders. I love to watch people work, play games, eat healthy food, write, and engage in creative activities. I am a big advocate for working with people with mental illness, and I love seeing people gain weight and exercise. It is important to talk about this with your therapist before any decisions are made, because you need to know why this person has such a hard time dealing with what they experience and how to help them. I have had people diagnosed with BPD who do not really need help or anything, because they do not believe the things they experience. I am not sure if this is a good or bad thing. I have been with people who have had such difficult times with people with mental illness, and I just do not know why this exists. I am just curious, if anyone else has this issue or experience please tell me what you feel like. Thanks.;0.21;0.22;;;;;;;;;"My final exam is near, but my mental health is getting worse.

What treatment options are available?;"Psychiatric or cognitive/psychotherapy. Many people think that mental health services might be the only way to treat a mental health condition. However, there are many resources available on the internet, like the DSM-5. While there is no information on the list, these providers offer services such as the following: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (BCT) - Provides individuals with a way to learn to overcome difficulties, and other psychotherapy tools for recovering from mental health problems. Psychotherapy - Provides individuals with strong relationships with their loved ones. These techniques are often helpful in setting boundaries, helping them to get better, and providing them with a supportive and flexible environment. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is a cognitive behavioral treatment, offers a new approach to treatment based on the idea of ""emotional integration,"" by providing individuals with a new set of rules about what counts as healthy and how to be able to respond appropriately to stressors. The CBT process is based on cognitive therapy, and is usually followed by an assessment of the individual and the cognitive abilities necessary to achieve a goal. Specific terms for CBT include: Change your ways of thinking. Learn to focus on the emotional and cognitive responses of your loved one. Learn to focus on making decisions based on a goal.

What is mental health?;Psychosis is often associated with mental illness, especially in the context of family members being diagnosed as having mental health problems. While mental illness does not necessarily always manifest itself in everyday actions such as suicide, mental illness usually manifests itself as a symptom, including depression, anxiety, or mood swings. Depression usually manifests itself through substance abuse, substance use, or other behavior that may not be helpful to yourself, such as the taking of or access to prescription drugs. Although some mental illness may appear at first to be self-inflicted, such as a mental health episode triggered by an episode of alcohol, it may soon develop into a mental illness that affects everyone else, including family members. For example, depression may be triggered by an episode of bulimia or anxiety, or by an episode of stress. An episode of anxiety may result in mental illness in the family, in particular if the illness is triggered by an episode of psychosis. A psychotic episode may even include a feeling of psychosis or a mental illness that is triggered by the symptoms of a psychotic episode, as described by a clinical psychologist. Many factors that may contribute to psychotic illness are complex, including: emotional, physical, social, and psychological problems. Psychological symptoms, such as panic attacks and hallucinations, may also trigger psychosis. Anorexia nervosa, or bulimia, may also be triggered by an episode of a psychotic episode. Anorexia may even lead to suicide,itzvivisection, or anorexia. If an episode of anorexia is associated with an underlying psychosis, mental health professionals should seek professional help in order to learn more about the disorder and to help the family recover from the illness. If the episode does not have the usual underlying psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, depression, and substance abuse, treatment strategies may be helpful.””;0.03;0.04;;;;;;;;;Frequent bouts of anger and depression, especially if you have depression;;

Is it fair to ask may partner if he can refrain from talking about calories? My partner is an endurance athlete and has been increasing his training intensity, frequency, etc. It is happened a handful of times now where, around meal time, he will reference how many calories he burned per his app or whatever he uses to program his workouts. For context, he references calories in this context like, “I am ready to eat because I am so unusually hungry, which makes sense because I apparently burned x calories during my workout”. He is aware of my ED history and has been supportive so far. I want to ask him not to talk about calories in front of me because it is honestly triggering. That said, I do not know how to approach this conversation or if it is even fair of me to make this request. TIA for any advice or support.;I would rather avoid things that are being said than what is actually going on in your life or your relationship. A lot of times these things have no relationship with any of the things that have happened. I think it is fair to ask for some info and guidance on what to do when something genuinely upsets you. You should not be asking for anything without looking at it in context. Even if it may not be the same thing, if you are uncomfortable with it, ask yourself if it is worth the risk. Some examples of situations I know of where you might consider asking questions to a trusted friend/relative: a doctor is a trusted friend who will have a conversation with you about your health and treatment, but you probably will not have much experience with a patient or the doctor for that matter. They may be able to work out some things about your body and what your symptoms are, but you should do not expect these things. Also, you should ask for some sort of referral or professional referral that will help with your relationship. They should also be able to help you decide on a plan of care if it does not seem appropriate for your family or if the doctor will be able to handle the matter. Even if you can say no to a request, it still may not make you feel better about yourself or others. Also, it is not right to offer your partner the option of a prescription of laxatives, so it is best to say no when talking to him.;0.21;0.25;;;;;;;;;Do not get the impression that you are alone or struggling with mental health.

I need advice on how to approach my depressed girlfriend. I am seeing her tonight for the first time in a few days. Last time I saw her, I noticed her teeth were unclean, to the point there was physical build up on them. She is my girlfriend, so obviously she is going to want a kiss, but I highly doubt she is brushed them since then. If that is the case, what is the best way to tell her I do not want to kiss her if she has not brushed her teeth in weeks? I need to set my hygienic boundaries but I do not want to offend her or make her feel bad and judged.;If you think your girlfriend may be getting angry, then your girlfriend might be annoyed with you and are going to make you angry. There is nothing wrong with wanting something that feels good to you or to her, but what do you do when she has already been there before? Let her know that she is not the only one who is angry at you for being rude, stupid, or disrespectful. She might find it difficult to stop herself from making her feelings known to others, so just be honest and say that you will not force her to brush her teeth after that, or you could go ahead and try and force her to brush them again in the future. Do not tell her that you are annoyed about it and that she needs to calm down, or that you are just taking advantage of her discomfort and do not feel shame at her. Just be honest and say that she has got a lot to learn and that this is a difficult situation to handle. That she has not yet realized how much she wants to learn and is struggling in her head. Do not try to force her to brush them but be honest with yourself about your disappointment and disappointment. If she does not brush her teeth in weeks, you will see her as someone who needs to do more to find an outlet and become active in her life. She has the potential to change the way she thinks and feels, and will be happier, healthier, and more connected to you. If her teeth do not get brushed, she may be extremely upset with you and might go into panic mode.;0.16;0.25;;;;;;;;;"Psych Support Groups are for people with schizophrenia, amitriptyline B (also known as buprenorphine), bipolar disorder, or other psychiatric conditions that may affect your mental health.

Partners drug test kit was positive. I am seeking advice. My partner of 10 years has always struggled with addiction. Heroin in the past, opioids and benzos etc. He is currently getting monthly buvidal (Buprenorphine) injections at his doctor.. I have been trying to support him as much as I can. We have been through a lot and I adore him. He is not a bad human, he is a hard working beautiful human that is struggling. Last night I took a drink from a water bottle in my car, that he had bought that day - it tasted like chemicals and I felt strange after. Upon asking him, he denyed anything (maybe It was in my head). I got an at home drug test kit this morning and tested the bottle/ water. It tested positive for opioids and methadone. I confronted him and he said he f'd up.. I do not know what to do.. it is the looking me in the eyes and lying.. I feel like such a fool. We are actively trying to conceive.. I am feeling numb as it is just a repeat cycle of dishonesty. The trust is broken. I do not know who to turn to for support.. for either of us. I have attended appointments with his doctor, I did not think opioids were supposed to have an affect when on the injections.. that taking drugs were pointless. I do not know what to do anymore.. I am exhausted by it.. and I am fully aware he is too.;"My friend of 10 years has been addicted to opioids for almost 2 years now, and when he was admitted last night he did not even know how to manage the pain. He is going through a lot of withdrawals with Xanax. Xanax is not an opioid; it is a substance that he suffers from. This is not an attempt to get him to take medication; it is a habit he developed over time, and he will still use it. I have been helping him. I know he wants to have a relationship with us now, he just is too scared. It is not something that I can relate to. His response to me is ""you got what you need"" and ""you have your medicine"" and ""how do you manage it""? I have talked to him privately about this, I do not want to hear them tell him anything negative. I do not want to be the one to hurt him, this was not a simple question to ask. His answer to me is ""you need to help yourself and yourself alone"" and his response is ""I know you got what you need"". I do not want him to have to choose between my comfort zone, his health, and our future.";0.13;0.21;;;;;;;;;;;
I have a final exam soon but I have mental health problems. What should I do?;You are only 22years old. The entire Exam is over and you will be taking the next one at 22. So let me just say that this is a very special day and I really want to thank you all for everything you have done. We all know you are going to be extremely busy at the end of the day with the exams, but this is your chance to finally get some tips on how to help yourself as best as possible and get your mental health treated as a priority. You know you have been through some tough times but if you have been honest with yourself it seems that everything you have been through over the years has been really good. You are going to be working harder and harder but you will also be showing great resilience, selflessness and compassion for others. You will also be feeling a lot better in your relationships with people you know, which will help you in the long run. Keep an open mind on your relationships and make sure you are doing things you can do to help your situation, and do not get frustrated. You will be able to do whatever you need to do for the future. Even if you do not get to the end of the exam you will still be there for the people to see. That is all. Thank you so much for the support and you are going to be so proud of you. Now, in the end you will have to decide what to do next in terms of what to do, how to do it and where to go for the rest of your life. Thank you. You will also be able to hear from other people on your journey. I know you have been through some tough times but let me just say that the past year or so has not been a bad one either. There will be times you will get angry, lose interest in your hobbies, and end up on an empty stomach or on the phone with a doctor. There will be times you will feel overwhelmed and want someone else to take care of you but these days you are still the people you would like to be with, and they still need you to be with.

Describe mental health.;my depression and anxiety go back and forth over time with me but I just really want to say that I have developed a very strong relationship with my mental health. I am not a psychiatrist or anything like that because there are a lot of things that go into diagnosing mental illness and I would like to give you some background to help explain these things a little bit. I am not a manic person like some of the people have suggested (and I do not think I am alone in this), and the things that I think are in my head have become quite severe (I have recently seen some really bad episodes, even though there is still a few that I do not understand) and there is something that I feel like a complete freak and that I cannot handle. I am really struggling with my self esteem and I need a way to express myself without fear of what my symptoms could be or being perceived. I have had a long term relapse that I am currently dealing with that I will not stop doing to myself. I feel like this is the case for me as well because in general I am quite anxious and angry and can feel myself start crying and not be able to concentrate because my anxiety keeps me from being able to concentrate. I do not really understand how my mood works and I get anxious when I think it does not work, even though I am not in therapy. I often find myself thinking that the reason I am anxious is because of my anxiety, i.e. my anxiety makes me anxious. But in reality, I am just being really anxious that people will notice if I am anxious because I will be taking a bath or something and I cannot help feeling like a freak. I feel like I am literally in complete control and nothing is coming back to normal. That is why I have been struggling with depression for a long time now. It is not a bad thing though. I feel like it makes me feel completely alone and not really able to deal with anything or anything at all. My anxiety is not because I am feeling anxious but because I feel so bad. I feel like it is not good enough for me to be around people that feel so bad and try to put me down if they see me as being isolated and just a random freak. If I have been experiencing this, I would like to be able to say some things and say that my life is not in great shape and that I just need to get better at dealing with these things.

Do not try to force her to brush them but be honest with yourself about your disappointment and disappointment. If she does not brush her teeth in weeks, you will see her as someone who needs to do more to find an outlet and become active in her life. She has the potential to change the way she thinks and feels, and will be happier, healthier, and more connected to you. If her teeth do not get brushed, she may be extremely upset with you and might go into panic mode."",0.16,0.25";;
Is it appropriate to request that my partner refrain from bringing up calories? My partner has been upping the volume, frequency, and other aspects of his training. He has mentioned how many calories he expended according to his app or whatever he uses to schedule his workouts a few times recently, usually around mealtime. He is aware of my past with eating disorders and has so far shown support. Since talking about calories in front of me is actually triggering, I want to ask him to refrain. Having said that, I'm not sure how to start this conversation or even if my request is reasonable. TIA for any assistance or counsel.;I am sorry for my lack of clarity on this. I have been on a diet (and I think a lot of people on this site are just not familiar with the terms, and I want to make sure everyone understands that I do not do this every day, because I want to make sure my partners understand) for quite a while. Over time, my partner has developed a lot of body fat, and I have been eating a bit less and I have not been cutting back in volume, even if it helps with the discomfort. As you can imagine, that feels pretty crappy when I am not eating. It is not the same, and I am thankful for it and am grateful I know he knows about it.;0.33;0.3;;;;;;;;;;;
How should I approach my depressed girlfriend? I need advice. Tonight is the first time I've seen her in a few days. When I last saw her, I observed that her teeth were so filthy that there was actual buildup on them. She is my girlfriend, so it goes without saying that she will want to kiss me, but I seriously doubt she has kissed them afterwards. If that's the case, how can I tell her if she hasn't washed her teeth in days that I don't want to kiss her? While I must establish my own boundaries for hygiene, I do not want to hurt her feelings or make her feel terrible or criticized.;A lot of things go down in life. There are no words to describe it. So try to get rid of the negative emotions, the bad experiences, or the doubts. There is no wrong way. The only way to help your girlfriend is to understand your feelings. There are many positive ways to go about your life. I recommend trying to understand them, as much as you can.;0.29;0.24;;;;;;;;;"Partners drug test kit was positive. I am seeking advice. My partner of 10 years has always struggled with addiction. Heroin in the past, opioids and benzos etc. He is currently getting monthly buvidal (Buprenorphine) injections at his doctor.. I have been trying to support him as much as I can. We have been through a lot and I adore him. He is not a bad human, he is a hard working beautiful human that is struggling. Last night I took a drink from a water bottle in my car, that he had bought that day - it tasted like chemicals and I felt strange after. Upon asking him, he denyed anything (maybe It was in my head). I got an at home drug test kit this morning and tested the bottle/ water. It tested positive for opioids and methadone. I confronted him and he said he f'd up.. I do not know what to do.. it is the looking me in the eyes and lying.. I feel like such a fool. We are actively trying to conceive.. I am feeling numb as it is just a repeat cycle of dishonesty. The trust is broken. I do not know who to turn to for support.. for either of us.

I am exhausted by it.. and I am fully aware he is too.,""My friend of 10 years has been addicted to opioids for almost 2 years now, and when he was admitted last night he did not even know how to manage the pain.

This is not an attempt to get him to take medication;" it is a habit he developed over time, and he will still use it. I have been helping him. I know he wants to have a relationship with us now, he just is too scared. It is not something that I can relate to. His response to me is """"you got what you need"""" and """"you have your medicine"""" and """"how do you manage it""""? I have talked to him privately about this, I do not want to hear them tell him anything negative. I do not want to be the one to hurt him, this was not a simple question to ask. His answer to me is """"you need to help yourself and yourself alone"""" and his response is """"I know you got what you need"""". I do not want him to have to choose between my comfort zone, his health, and our future."",0.13,0.21"
Partners' drug test kit returned a positive result. I need some guidance. For the past ten years, my spouse has battled addiction. In the past, heroin, opioids, benzos, etc. He currently receives monthly injections of buvidal (buprenorphine) from his physician. I've been doing everything I can to help him. Since the circle of dishonesty is just repeated, I am feeling numb. Trust has been betrayed. For either of us, I am unsure of who to turn to for help. I've been to visits with his doctor since I didn't believe opioids should have an effect while being injected and that taking medicines was useless. I'm at a loss on what to do now. It has worn me out.;Not sure if you should go to rehab or buy a drug test kit. I have been having a lot of problems lately. As an ex I have had hallucinations when I walk into the facility. I was in a mental health facility for 10 years but never saw anything like this. It is not common for me to see hallucinations when I walk into the facility. That is to say, I have no idea where to go. If you know of anything, you should check it out. It is nice to have your doctor talk with you about your mental health, to see if it is worth the time to go. Also, I am a nurse who does not take a lot of Xanax. It is not an overdose so you do not have to overdose. Also, some people will go with a prescribed meds or a lot of other medications. Also, if you have any doubts that are not the case, talk to a licensed mental health nurse before you go. Her experience with opioids is anecdotal.;0.12;0.17;;;;;;;;;;;
Make this;Hey everyone! Today I want to get some advice on using mindfulness techniques to help me cope with my past. My mother has always been very sensitive to my anxiety and depression, but recently I started noticing that she has improved drastically. She is doing well at school and her grades are doing really well, and I really hope that you will follow her lead. She has been struggling with anxiety for a while now, and I recently saw her progress with mindfulness. This is going to be helpful to us all. Just an honest question: would I rather spend my free time at work or at my computer playing video games. I am not sure how much longer would that be good for me, but I do not have any other life to play video games in. I am not even sure I would even consider it a good idea to spend my free time at work, but I am really thankful to have some time to play games and spend time meditating, and I do not think I can do much better than that. I am sorry to any people who might have been hurt, and you all deserve a chance to be healthy and happy. I appreciate all the positive feedback so far, and I would like to hear you guys get some tips on how you can actually start focusing more on what you do not have right now. I do not know how much longer you will be doing it, but I would love to know how much longer you will be practicing it, or are you already practicing it a lot? Also, I would love to hear your thoughts on how you can start putting down some extra time for yourself. I do not plan on spending your free time at work as you have the option to do it for yourself. I am sure you all would love to be able to do that, but I really do not think there is anything you can do to help. What can you say you think we need to do to get better, and what advice would you give for people who are struggling with anxiety? I would love to hear from you, and I hope to hear from you as much as possible.;0.02;0.04;;;;;;;;;"I have a final exam soon but I have mental health problems. What should I do?,""You are only 22years old. The entire Exam is over and you will be taking the next one at 22. So let me just say that this is a very special day and I really want to thank you all for everything you have done. We all know you are going to be extremely busy at the end of the day with the exams, but this is your chance to finally get some tips on how to help yourself as best as possible and get your mental health treated as a priority. You know you have been through some tough times but if you have been honest with yourself it seems that everything you have been through over the years has been really good. You are going to be working harder and harder but you will also be showing great resilience, selflessness and compassion for others. You will also be feeling a lot better in your relationships with people you know, which will help you in the long run. Keep an open mind on your relationships and make sure you are doing things you can do to help your situation, and do not get frustrated. You will be able to do whatever you need to do for the future. Even if you do not get to the end of the exam you will still be there for the people to see. That is all. Thank you so much for the support and you are going to be so proud of you. Now, in the end you will have to decide what to do next in terms of what to do, how to do it and where to go for the rest of your life. Thank you. You will also be able to hear from other people on your journey. I know you have been through some tough times but let me just say that the past year or so has not been a bad one either. There will be times you will get angry, lose interest in your hobbies, and end up on an empty stomach or on the phone with a doctor. There will be times you will feel overwhelmed and want someone else to take care of you but these days you are still the people you would like to be with, and they still need you to be with. You will also see how much you have grown from the moment you left school and how much you have made in your life since."",0.37,0.4";;
My finnal exam near, bt my mentall helth is geting wors. Any advise?;I am having a serious mental health crisis, as I am sure many others have. My mom diagnosed me as bipolar last year and she has been making me suicidal since I was 9 years old. She even diagnosed me with a personality disorder and I knew from the start that I was having mental health issues. I was diagnosed with OCD and I am now facing major depressive issues and anxiety. She has been telling me privately I am bipolar and I am afraid of this because of it. I feel really bad for her. The first year I did not have any problems with me, it was not until I was 20 years old that I really started to notice subscale anxiety. The symptoms were usually mild, then the worst happened, when I was 12, and then I started to experience a huge amount of anxiety and depression. I cannot think straight anymore and it has been literally for months now, my parents told me I am psychotic because of my obsessive obsession with my life and my mental health. My mom also told me I will get an ED if I ever do any of these things. I really wish I could say that, but I am really in shock and terrified. It is really hard for me to relate to my life at all, how bad it is and what to do, and I am afraid that what she has said about me is true. My mom feels very bad and scared to see me again. She even gave me a letter saying I am not a great person and that I will never be okay with me again. She also thinks that I am too self-centered and that I need to take a break from my life and that my anxiety is the reason I am depressed so much. I am so frustrated that this is happening. My dad is going to be in the hospital next week and I have to start taking Xanax to calm my thoughts. That is going to take years. My therapist is going to have to work with me and I do not know how to support myself or my family. I am so anxious that I am going to get my medicine, and I do not think I can take it because of the stress I put on my mental health. So for now, I just feel hopeless. This is a horrible situation for me and it has been for the last month or two. I am still traumatized by my experiences, and I hate to think that is how I will be able to heal from this. I know I am going to make a major mistake if I do not step down from my job soon, but at the same time, my situation is so overwhelming, and I am so confused and scared. Is there anything I can do to help? Edit: Hi Everyone,;;;;;;;;;;;;;
My doctor will be in the hospital tomorrow for my mental health problems; and it is been a month since I have had any problems with my mental health. She told me I am not crazy for being depressed; but I know that is not what she meant. She did not know I had been diagnosed with OCD and that I am not going to be able to get my life back on track. I am so scared that I will be in the hospital; and I am sorry if my doctors do not help me. I need support; but I am not sure if I will ever be able to stand up for myself in the future. I am so afraid that my parents might not be around to help me; but I have to fight for my life. I want to say THANK YOU so much to my doctors for all the support and prayers that they have been giving me. I am so sorry I have to go through this;" it is my worst nightmare.""";0.22;0.28;;;;"Which types of people are affected from a mental disorder?,""People with Fenner/Fenner's Syndrome are people with a similar mental illness as us (Fenner). They are usually older (i.e. 20) or black. They are generally self-diagnosed as having a specific mental illness, or as having mental illnesses related to depression. Often it is only in families where the person with mental illness is more identified as being at risk of getting in trouble or getting into trouble, as opposed to people of similar physical or mental disability. People with other forms of mental illness do not experience the same symptoms of a mental disorder, such as hallucinations or delusions."",0.45,0.29";;
Who do mental illnes afect?;I know this one is from the USA and I think it is my own personal opinion on it. I have bipolar and schizophrenia, and the things I did, I believe, are just different. But my depression has been very clear to me since last year. It affects me more at times than it does my body. It was not until the last week or so that I felt that way, and now, it is gotten to the point where it does not even matter. And I feel like I do not know where my life is, and that I have a bad outlook on my life. I am sure there are lots of people in my life that feel that way too. And then there is my girlfriend who is pretty much everyone in this world does not know what they have done or that they have done. And then there are others who are just very open to change, that just do not know what they want to change and that they are just too afraid of change. And then there is someone who I think is incredibly close to me who has mental illness, and they have just started showing signs of that too. I would assume that if this is someone that they have never met before and is looking for some advice, it is going to be very helpful, and hopefully that will help. I have always been so thankful for them, and I am very thankful for their kindness in finding me. My advice to them is to think about it as soon as you are in the mood and see if it is worth it. If you see someone that is very close to you, give them a hug, and if possible ask them some questions. If they do not want to answer, ask themUTERS to have some kind of therapy session for them. It is okay for them to be with you all day and they will get to meet new people. Thank you for all the kind words and hugs, it has been a wonderful experience.;0.2;0.21;;;;;;;;;;;
Wh tretment option are abailable?;Abdominal surgery is one option. There are some other option. It is still under consideration, like ED. The ED is not a serious disorder. It is a symptom of a mental health disorder, not something everyone can say about. It is a symptom that has a social impact and might be triggered by an intrusive thought. If the ED does not respond positively to a given medication, the patient is still at high risk of developing a severe mental health condition. ED symptoms are usually not due to ED and can be ignored and treated with medication.;0.11;0.13;;;;;;;;;"Which treatments could I receive?,""I am sorry if the title of this post might not seem obvious, but I am going to talk about anxiety and depression as two very different problems. I am a graduate student in the psychology department at Northwestern University, and the following is a conversation with a research psychologist. Basically I am trying to get help for my anxiety. One of the primary things I would like to ask is:";;
;;;;;;;;;;;;"Does anyone else experience anxiety with medications that may be helpful for you? And if so, what is the relationship between those medications and your symptoms? Do you have any experience with the medication they are prescribed? Do you know if these medications are effective in controlling anxiety or not? Is the medication itself safe and effective for you? Does it have any side effects? Do you have any advice for the general public? I just want to know how to help if the advice I have given is not working. I just want to know what to do about it. Also, I would like to ask a question: is this only the beginning of a conversation with a person that genuinely cares about me? I just wanted to make sure you understand that I am not just talking about anxiety and depression, my depression is not merely an issue that can be treated, but a real issue that is affecting people around me    It is incredibly difficult to be active with my partner, my parents, and my friends. There is no doubt that this is a very complex issue and I have researched and researched a lot of different treatment options. I would love to hear your thoughts and experiences, and how you would best help me. Also, you are an amazing person with so much potential, and I hope that this post helps anyone struggling with anxiety or depression."",0.08,0.14";;

One (CSE) is a non-profit group that offers a specialized area of expertise in treating mental illness, like mental health and addiction. They focus on people with an eating disorder and depression. The other (NCHS) is a group that provides non-profit support and resources. They specialize in helping individuals struggling with eating disorders. N Teacher and N Psychiatrist also specialize in mental health issues related to eating disorders and substance use disorders. Both groups have a focus on support for those with disorders."",0.2,0.24";;

I am not a psychiatrist or anything like that because there are a lot of things that go into diagnosing mental illness and I would like to give you some background to help explain these things a little bit. I am not a manic person like some of the people have suggested (and I do not think I am alone in this), and the things that I think are in my head have become quite severe (I have recently seen some really bad episodes, even though there is still a few that I do not understand) and there is something that I feel like a complete freak and that I cannot handle. I am really struggling with my self esteem and I need a way to express myself without fear of what my symptoms could be or being perceived. I have had a long term relapse that I am currently dealing with that I will not stop doing to myself. I feel like this is the case for me as well because in general I am quite anxious and angry and can feel myself start crying and not be able to concentrate because my anxiety keeps me from being able to concentrate. I do not really understand how my mood works and I get anxious when I think it does not work, even though I am not in therapy. I often find myself thinking that the reason I am anxious is because of my anxiety, i.e. my anxiety makes me anxious. But in reality, I am just being really anxious that people will notice if I am anxious because I will be taking a bath or something and I cannot help feeling like a freak. I feel like I am literally in complete control and nothing is coming back to normal. That is why I have been struggling with depression for a long time now. It is not a bad thing though. I feel like it makes me feel completely alone and not really able to deal with anything or anything at all. My anxiety is not because I am feeling anxious but because I feel so bad. I feel like it is not good enough for me to be around people that feel so bad and try to put me down if they see me as being isolated and just a random freak. If I have been experiencing this, I would like to be able to say some things and say that my life is not in great shape and that I just need to get better at dealing with these things. The more I have been doing this for longer than I can even begin to explain it, the more anxious I get."",0.02,0.03";;
